Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 27, 2020",A,"One of the BEST profs at UCLA!! Take her if you have a chance 100%. Can be sometimes confusing/delves too much into the high-level concepts, but, overall, a very helpful and engaging lecturer. Her exams are almost exactly as her hw, she grades very fairly and, overall, she is THE QUEEN OF MATHEMATICS. Sherry, I love you. My decision to pursue Applied Math was solidified because of u."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 23, 2020",A,"I don't say this lightly: she is an amazing professor. S-tier. 
Obviously we had a pandemic interrupt the last week of class and finals, so I won't really be talking about her final that much. Suffice to say she handled the situation mercifully and was very helpful throughout the crisis.
The midterms were completely fair questions. The questions were no more or less difficult than the medium-hard textbook questions, and there were no ""tricks."" Straight forward, an easy A/B if you study. 
Homework was sometimes kind of tedious, but I did all of the assignments in <2 hrs and got a 90% in homework overall, so don't worry about the time.
The lectures got increasingly difficult to understand conceptually, starting around directional derivatives, but even without a super solid understanding of the background it was easy to pick up the procedures we had to do. With about an hour of extra studying per week I was able to fill in all the blanks.
Sherry is really REALLY smart. You will see this in her lecture style, as she loves to stick to proper mathematical convention and uses academic terms (think ""a priori"" lol). This isn't actually a negative, I thought it was a good way to get more comfortable with proper notation and commonly used terms. 
The only negative is that sometimes the lectures weren't planned out thoroughly enough and there were a few times where she would just erase the board and rewind like 30 seconds, but that became less frequent as the quarter went on. 
Very good prof for this class, would take again."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 17, 2020",NR,"**Extenuating circumstances warning** I took the final for this class in the middle of a raging virus epidemic (which is still going on as I speak), so perhaps the situation can speak more or less for itself depending on when you read this. However, I strongly believe that a person's true colors show during times of intense distress and difficulty and Sherry Gong is something of a hero. She had sent us almost a hundred emails constantly trying to help us and figure out a solution to online finals while also being fair and accommodating to the fact that every one of her students were affected in different ways. She not only made the final exam collaborative and open book, but also offered real time personalized help on the practice exam and final. She even accounted for the fact that in an almost 200+ class there may be people who have less friends than others and went and found groupme collaborating groups and other resources for their benefit. I have, in my life, seldom had a teacher who cares this much about the well being of her students in times of incredible anxiety and distress. As grateful as I am to the medical professionals and other society members who help us through times like these, I don't think teachers get enough credit for the amazing work they do. Thank you Sherry and no matter what grade I receive in this class, your commitment to our success in times of hardship is something I will never forget."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 30, 2020",A,"Sherry Gong is extremely helpful and kind. As many of the other winter 2020 reviews have already described, she went out of her way to ease out the struggles of students amid the coronavirus pandemic. I've not heard of any other professor who is so deeply invested in their student's welfare. She doesn't care about grades and emphasizes on learning - this even showed in the way she designed a collaborative final for us. This might sound dramatic but I will never forget Professor Gong's generosity."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 29, 2020",A,"I love Sherry Gong!! This quarter was absolutely crazy because of Covid-19 but Sherry was very on top of everything and made sure all her students had an equal opportunity to succeed. Im not going to lie, she made the final collaborative and it saved my grade. I ended with an A an I probably should have gotten an A- or even a B+ but instead of letting the epidemic hurt students, she gave us an opportunity. Throughout the course she also didn't assign that much work, midterms were pretty straightforward, and lectures were actually really good because she can tell when the class is confused. If you get the chance, absolutely take this class with Sherry. She is a GODSEND!!!"
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 29, 2019",A-,"I have mixed feelings about this class. Sherry's homework assignments and midterms were extremely easy but her final was freaking hard. This kind of off-set everything. Additionally, she promised that she would not make the final intentionally hard to lower the average, but honestly, she did. Sherry, however, is still very caring and gentle. She's very easy to approach and her office hours were helpful. In the future, I hope she makes her exams consistent."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 5, 2019",A,"I agree that sometimes it is better and more understandable to read the text book. But, her class is the type that you only have to spend around one hour each week to get an A. Her midterms are very easy. But finals are comparatively hard, with great emphasis on optimization problems and Lagrange multipliers. That being said, if you do all of the homework, the final is not difficult."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 28, 2019",NR,"I honestly had an easier time reading the textbook over attending her lectures. I still don't know what I received in the class and it's been two weeks since the final. The midterms were fair and she offered extra credit on them, but the final made no sense because of how easy the rest of the class was in comparison."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 29, 2019",N/A,"This class is a prime example of UCLA classes that develop trust issues. I honestly do not understand why tests that are given out are so easy, yet come finals there is a gigantic difficulty spike ultimately determining your final grade. This is a word of warning to any one who takes her class: the final will kick your ass. Do not let your guard down with the easy midterms and homework. She is lying to your face when she says as long as you understand the homework and midterms fairly well you get an A because that is for sure not the case. Overall, would've been a better professor if she didn't try to let your guard down. It just goes to show you cannot trust most professors at UCLA."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 25, 2020",A,"I would die for Sherry Gong. She is an amazing lecturer and gives you lots of worked examples in lectures. Her exams are the same difficulty as the homework and are worded similarly. Sometimes she loses students during lecture or goes off a tangent about proofs, but she does a mini recap in the next lecture which is super helpful."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 1, 2020",A,"SHERRY I LOVE YOU WITH MY ENTIRE SOUL!So obviously I took this class in the midst of a global pandemic, so our last week of the class was thrown for a loop, but I'll talk about how beautifully Professor Gong handled that later in this review. I hated 31B with every fiber of my being, so I was nervous coming into this class. Professor Gong's lectures are so clear and easy to follow - something I've noticed with a lot of math professors is that they are SUPER insanely smart but suck at passing that smartness onto us and explaining how their brains approach the problems. Sherry is literally a genius but she made this class understandable, approachable, and just generally a very level playing ground. I've never liked math before but her lectures broke down multivariable calculus into manageable bites of info that were easy to absorb and easy to link together into a picture that made sense. She made me like math and see the beauty in math. Freaking legend. Homework is super easy to complete - a very fair number of questions that, if you pay attention in lecture, you should have no problems finishing. Homework is graded partially on accuracy and partially on completion. But they aren't brain-splittingly hard problems so you should be okay. I do wanna quickly add that my TA was useless. I believe there were 3 TA's in the quarter that I took it. One of the TA's was my previous TA from 31B, who I didn't enjoy very much (Tambe), but I ended up with Thorton and OH MY GOD discussion was such a waste of time. I truly think I lost brain cells but hey I still went every week. Even with a mind-numbing section experience, I still learned well enough from Gong's lectures that I felt okay. The midterms both were very fair - problems just like the homework ones and examples she does in class. The formula sheets were helpful and the class isn't memorization heavy - you just gotta know your stuff and understand how to apply equations, which Sherry made very easy to understand. Our final was a fiasco, but Professor Gong was honestly an angel through it all. I was hearing horror stories of math professors making their finals extremely hard to make up for the fact that they were open note and online, but instead of using the pandemic to hurt us and our grades, Professor Gong was accomodating, making the final super fair in terms of questions and offering to help us out with them and giving us the opportunity to collaborate. Yes, the class ended up being easy to get an A in because of this unexpected change, but I still feel like I learned something. I still feel like I really absorbed the material and learned calculus rather than just sitting there, learning it all for the quarter, and then purging my brain of all the math. This is my last math class at UCLA, but I'm so thankful that it was not only a great experience, but also left a good taste in my mouth of mathematics as a whole. Thank you Professor Gong for a great quarter."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 1, 2020",A,"PROS:- The homework workload is not bad at all- The homework problems correlate with the lectures very well, so you are not expected to do things that aren't discussed in the lecture- The midterms were not hard. There might be one section where you are tested on theoretical concepts, but the rest are calculations. You are also given a formula sheet. As long as you do the homework and studied somewhat, you should do fine. - I heard that the final is much harder than the midterms. Of course, the coronavirus could've changed things a bit, but the final was about the same as the midterm for me. - During the lecture, she gives you a lot of examples. - Most importantly, she is a very helpful and nice professor. When the coronavirus thing happened, she sent us dozens of emails telling us what her plans are and what to do to prepare for the final. During the final, she joined our class gc and cleared up any confusion. 
CONS:- Sometimes the lectures can be disorganized. She can be in the middle of a problem and then switch gears to talk about something that should've been covered earlier. This tends to lead to some confusion.- This is a very calculation-based class and a lot of the lecture covers examples. She is very good at providing examples but sometimes her explanations of concepts can be vague. Her examples help with homework, but reading the summary of the end of sections provides clearer concept explanations.
OVERALL: Take my impressions with a grain of salt given the coronavirus situation, but I definitely recommend Professor Gong and will take her again if possible."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 29, 2020",A+,"Dr Gong is a pretty decent lecturer and really tries to explain her concepts well. She goes over a lot of examples on each topic which helps a lot. However, there have a number of times where she rushes through a concept and doesn't really explain it, especially towards the end of class, which can be quite confusing.The midterms were pretty easy and straightforward and were fairly similar to the problems in the textbook."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 29, 2020",A,"Sherry is a really good professor. She is very approachable and I genuinely like her class a lot. The class has a usual 10% HW, 25% midterms and 40% final distribution. Her tests are quite simple and she has a few extra credit questions too. Lectures are pretty nice I would say, but the difficulty of the lectures increased around week 7. Definitely would recommend taking Sherry if you have the choice!"
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 27, 2020",A,"As a professor, Sherry Gong is one of the most understanding instructors I've ever had.During lecture, although she tends to talk fairly quickly, she always makes sure to stop after a chunk and wait a good amount of time to ask the class if there are any questions, and if there are, she will explain them thoroughly, even to the point where if she felt as if she didn't explain it well enough in class, she would send emails later that day updating the class.Her midterms were super fair, though not as easy as the previous year had. Our averages for both midterms were around 85%, which are still high, but definitely fair. They are just like the homework and she sends a detailed email a couple days leading up to the exam about what to expect. There were never any surprises. As for the final exam, although I took this class amid the whole coronavirus pandemic, Sherry Gong handled the whole situation beautifully. She was constantly sending us emails updating us on how we were going to approach the last two lectures and the final, and she was actively searching for ways she could help us prepare, hosting zoom office hours for us. She makes it a priority for her to balance fairness and equity as well as learning. Not only did she make the final exam COLLABORATIVE (which I know many other professors were very adamant against cheating), but she said she was open to emails herself DURING the actual final for those who may not have as many friends in the class, AND she sent out an email regarding a group chat for all of us to discuss the final in, which SHE JOINED HERSELF to clarify some misconceptions about certain problems on the practice final, which was pretty much identical to the actual final. She obviously cares a lot about her students. In one of her emails regarding collaboration on the final, her reasoning was that ""This is because I would like it if, even despite this whole stressful situation, people were still learning, at least a little."" That melts my heart. Also, she definitely reads bruinwalk and the UCLA subreddit. If you're reading this, just know that your entire Winter 2020 class wants to thank you for being so awesome."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 27, 2020",A,"GONG IS A QUEEN!!!! I took 31B in fall and barely passed so coming into 32A I thought id experience the same trauma. GONG was absolutely amazing, you just have to do the weekly hw and thats basically your midterm. DO GREAT on the midterms (38+/40) and just try your best for the final."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 27, 2020",A,"Professor Sherry Gong is the closest thing to a perfect professor you can ask for. She made a relatively difficult class way easier to understand while not sacrificing the fundamental concepts. She tries very hard to make sure the class really understands what she is teaching by taking questions and never turning down a question because it's ""obvious"". Her exams are pretty easy but she does spend a considerable amount of effort curating the extra credit problems.
I had to take the final amid a viral pandemic and she sent out so many emails reassuring us that we will do fine through the final and answered the tsunami of emails flooding to her in due time. I don't think I've ever seen a professor work so hard for their students. I've heard horror stories from my other friends taking other professors that made me really appreciate what a great professor I had."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 17, 2020",NR,"Sherry cares a lot for her students. I enjoy going to her class because I like seeing how happy she is teaching us. I would definitely take her class again if I had the chance. Some people talked about how her finals are hard. I didn't really get to experience that in person; not because I thought her finals were easy but because Winter quarter of 2020 is pretty much messed up by the coronavirus. For my finals, we were allowed to collaborate with other classmates, and it is even highly encouraged by the professor. I would say, if the coronavirus didn't happen and I took the finals like normal, I would probably consider the final as difficult. It is really different from her midterms but not CRAZY hard either. Anyways, Sherry is great. Go to her office hours because now I regret not getting to know Sherry more."

Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 13, 2019",A-,"This class...was very interesting. I took it Winter Quarter and for the most part it was okay until the final. Homework isn't due every week, but there are weekly quizzes in discussion, so no skipping discussion and no going to other discussion sections. For the most part, if you did homework problems, you would do well on the quizzes since the the quiz consisted of two questions and they were very much like the homework. As for Sherry, she is a great professor. Her lectures are concise and she does not focus too much on the proofs. This was good at first, because her midterms were just computation. I ended up getting 100 on the first and a high A on the second one. Not to mention that you also got a full sheet of paper for a cheat sheet. Depending on how much work you want to put into the class, you will be fine when it comes to the midterms. The final, however, that is another story. It's level of difficult was like two times that of the midterms. You could survive both midterms just knowing when to use what formula, but for the final you actually had to understand what was going on in order to apply it to some of the questions. I ended up getting a C on it. So study harder than just memorizing formulas and being a human calculator and you should be good. Hopefully. But overall as a professor, Sherry was very nice. She was easy to approach after class and during office hours, usually hosting extra office hours before an exam. I have also been told that she sometimes had brownies at her office hours."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 12, 2019",A,"1. [Difficulty]: ★★★☆(FAIRLY EASY. Just as most reviews say, the two midterms are easy with an average score above 90 percent. The final is, indeed, much harder than the midterms but still reasonable. If you study hard enough and do enough practice problems, the final should be moderate. In conclusion, even if you do not perform well in the final, you can still get an ideal score with the easy midterms and some extra credits Dr.Gong provides. PS: she allows cheatsheets.)
2.[Workload]:★★★★(The workload is LIGHT, homework is little with no more than ten questions, all of which come from the textbook, so you can easily find answers to them from the internet. Also, the homework will not be collected, but similar problems may appear on weekly quizzes, so do them for practice.)
3.[Lecture]:★★★☆(The lecture is OK. Be sure to go to the lectures and review with the textbook at the same time.)
4.[Conclusion]: Do take her classes, if you attend lectures, do the homework and practice problems on the textbook, getting an A should be fairly easy. Definitely, recommend taking her for any lower-division math classes."
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 30, 2019",A,"I really enjoyed taking 32A with professor Gong - not only did she do a good job of generally explaining the course material, but she really put in the extra effort to make sure the class ran well, and to make sure that we understood the material! She held extra office hours, responded to emails, and in-class would often re-explain previous concepts if the class seemed unclear on them - a really good skill! In my one-on-one interactions with her, she's been very helpful, even answering general questions I had about math; and my other friends in the class have found her office hours really helpful. In addition, the homework she gave was very pointed and relevant - if you did the homework every week, the midterms would be simple to do - no curveballs there! I will say, I did find the final to be quite challenging, and barely ended up getting an A overall - my only criticism of this class was that we didn't get a practice final, which made some of the questions a bit surprising. Overall though, Sherry is a great professor - she really puts in the extra mile to make sure her students understand her material, and I'd love to have her again!"
Sherry Gong,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 29, 2019",A,"I honestly feel that Sherry's dedication to this class is very underrated. Although she's not required to, she holds office hours 3 hours per week, and whenever she thinks we haven't fully understood a concept, she would explain it more in-depth during the next lecture. She constantly tries to make sure we're following her train of logic, answers all of our questions, and gives multiple interpretations of concepts/figures to help us visualize. In class and in her e-mails, she tells us very clearly what we have/don't have to know for an exam, and does her best to be fair on tests. On the second midterm, she allowed us to submit corrections for 2 questions for a regrade just because she thought that they were worth more points than necessary compared to other questions. Sherry clearly cares about her students and thinks it matters that they're learning. Maybe she tries hard to do the right thing because she's new, but I think she's a genuinely nice person at heart.
 However, I agree with the other reviewers that the final was significantly harder than the (very easy) midterms and that she might not have given us enough ""warnings"" to help us prepare for it. But I have taken other classes in the 30 series and it was definitely not unreasonable compared to other math finals."
Jasmine Trice,Film Tv 4,Introduction to Art and Technique of Filmmaking,Spring 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted July 4, 2020",A,"super easy A. took this spring 2020, so all of this was online. basically you have to do quizzes each week on tuesday and thursday that had queastjons based on the lecture and the film that we were supposed to watch. i got an A in the class by basically googling the synopsis of the movie and didn’t watch any of the movies and averaged 9/10 on the quizzes. you also have to buy a textbook that have some of the info on the quizzes. you also need to do discussion questions once a week, which are about 250 words and you need to reply to 2 other people to get full question. depends on your TA, because some TA’s will grade discussion questions harder while others will basically give you full points if you meet the word count and do the assignment on time. if you notice your getting points taken off bc of no reason, GET ON YOUR TA’S ASS. when i took it, my TA was randomly taking off points for no reason that numerous students basically called her out to the prof, who told the TA in question to chill with her grading. you also need to do a two projects (one project anytime from weeks 1-5 and another project that was due anytime from weeks 5-10. that were incredicinlu easy and took me less than 1 hour each. there wasn’t a midterm and there wasn’t a final. bottom line, this is one of the easiest GE’s i’ve taken. highly recommend."
Jasmine Trice,Film Tv 4,Introduction to Art and Technique of Filmmaking,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 24, 2019",A,"Professor Trice is incredible. She is devoted, respected, smart, knowledged. Her organization is on-point and the amount of detail and attention she puts into every single assignment instruction, rubric, syllabus, etc is second to none. I am a STEM person so I really didn't find the content all that interesting, but I could tell that she was engaging. She really cares about what the students have to say and takes a good amount of class to have several students give their insight. The class is very manageable. Her lectures give you everything you need to know from the readings, so you don't have to do those. The films are not the best, but they're interesting enough to pay attention to. You don't have to take notes during the screenings. Just bring a jacket because Melnitz is freezing!! The creative exercises are self-explanatory (she lays out the instructions so nicely for you), and you get to choose 2 of 5 assignments, so you really get to do projects that work better for you. The take home exams are kinda overwhelming at first glance, but they're really not that bad. The questions are easy to answer and they're obviously all open book, which is nice. We also got like practically a week with both exams, so there was enough time if you didn't leave it to the last minute. I don't know what I got on the final project, but it wasn't too bad if you manage your time well and choose an option that you know you can do well on. My TA was Brittany Murphy and I absolutely loved her. She's hilarious, smart, and genuinely cares for the well-being of her students. Easy A, but meh course content."
Jasmine Trice,Film Tv 4,Introduction to Art and Technique of Filmmaking,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 23, 2020",A+,"This class was pretty easy. The structure is each week you need to watch lectures, skim the reading, and watch a film or two to answer the questions on the quizzes, which are pretty straightforward. You also have to write short responses to questions on the discussion forums. Grades are 50% discussion forums/ replies, 15% for two projects, and 35% for the quizzes. It's kind of a lot of work but if you do it all you should get an A :). I enjoyed the lectures and I thought the subject material was pretty interesting."

I've taken so many online classes, and barely do the professors care if they haven't seen you in person, but Professor Trice is a HUGE exception. She responds to. every. single. student. within a day or two, and is very concerned about our learning. She explains her content well, and the quizzes and discussion essays are straightforward if you have listened to her lectures well. The class requires effort, but you're guaranteed an A as long as you do all the work and submit things on time.

Jasmine Trice,Film Tv 4,Introduction to Art and Technique of Filmmaking,Fall 2018,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 26, 2019",A-,"You show up to lecture and learn about how movies are made and different types of critical lenses to apply to watching movies. You write an essay or two, watch a movie or two every week, and skim through a very simple textbook. Occasionally, you're hit with some odd texts, but Professor Trice's lectures are the most helpful and comprehensive I think I will ever encounter at this school. Her slides are digestible, her engagement is impeccable, and she frequently gets students to participate just to clarify that we're all on the same page. The subject matter is fairly easy and fun, and if movies and art interest you at all, I think you're in for a treat. It's UCLA after all -- as a film major, I can attest to the quality of the program, and this intro class is just a tiny peak into what the rest of us are going to be spending our time grinding out. I hope I don't sound pretentious calling it all ""easy,"" as there was a very very large amount of shit that I learned about for the first time in this class. Lots of techniques, terms, and movies I'd never even heard about came from here, and many of those movies or styles are now some I can call my favorites. Take this class for the GE if it interests you, and film majors, don't worry too much about it! It's not hard nor boring."

Assigned readings: the textbook is pretty interesting. Supplemental readings are fun too, but they can be a bit long and difficult to read
Assigned films: tends to be older films but they're all quite enjoyable. 
Quizzes: tests whether you watched the film and the lectures. Doesn't really go into readings too much. 
Discussion forums: Required to post a 200-400 word response each week and comment on 2 classmates' responses. Overall pretty enjoyable process and I enjoyed it. 
Creative exercises: required to do 2 of these out of 5 choices. They are pretty fun, but I would recommend looking at the prompts early because some are definitely more challenging than others. 
Overall: pretty fair class that widened my perspective on film. I would say it does take a bit of time to watch the films and do the readings to actually enjoy the class, but it's well worth it."
Jasmine Trice,Film Tv 4,Introduction to Art and Technique of Filmmaking,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 24, 2019",A,"Though I took this as a GE class, I genuinely enjoyed many of the concepts taught. The course work is light with a few creative exercises, but the end of the quarter with the 2 take-home finals and the final project was highly writing-intensive and took a decent amount of time to complete. The professor is very clear and has engaging lectures, and I actually enjoyed critically thinking about films and being exposed to new ways of thinking.tldr: The professor is well-spoken and lectures well, the course work is easy, and the finals are lots of writing but not too bad."
Peiyun Lee,Mcd Bio 50,"Stem Cell Biology, Politics, and Ethics: Teasing Apart Issues",Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 8, 2020",NR,"Strengths: Dr. Lee seems very knowledgeable and the lectures and discussions are very interesting conversations.
Weaknesses: during discussions, it would be helpful for Dr. Lee to respond with positive affirmation after a student shares because it is really nerve wracking to speak in front of other students and it's hard to read other people's body language over zoom. In addition, I would advise Dr. Lee to be careful with her choice of words. During one particular discussion where we discussing an ethical situation that involved saving lives, I wanted to share my opinion and was sort of put on the spot by Dr. Lee. I don't usually mind being grilled but I was arguing for the unpopular opinion and Dr. Lee said ""I understand what you're trying to say but you're not putting it in a very elegant way"". I felt that comment was a little insensitive because it is hard to think on the spot and be grilled in front of the other students about a stance that most of them don't support. Therefore, she could have worded that better. Additionally, I feel that Dr. Lee could be more lenient with grading especially during this pandemic and MCDB 50 being a General Education class and not a Biology major class. It is pretty heavy on biology knowledge and the midterm free responses were graded pretty harshly.
If you are interested in stem cells and need to satisfy a GE requirement, it would be okay to take this class. Just make sure to double and triple check your midterm exam because they are very harsh with grading. Your responses need to match everything that was said in lectures and they take off big chunks of points very freely. My TA was Natalie G. and she was a really friendly and nice TA but I'm not sure about the other TA (Salena)."

Peiyun Lee,Mcd Bio 50,"Stem Cell Biology, Politics, and Ethics: Teasing Apart Issues",Spring 2017,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 19, 2017",A+,"MCDB 50 was a very interesting class. I genuinely enjoyed the material and learned a ton about these issues. I felt, however, that Professor Lee was one of the worst professors that I've had at UCLA. This is not me being biased against her because of a bad grade in the class––I received an A+. What I felt was the problem was this: with the amount of money that each of us pays to attend UCLA, I felt that very little time or effort was put in by Dr. Lee to make sure we succeeded. To start, for the midterm and final, you will not be given any practice exams, any study guide, or any other direction other than ""study the lecture slides."" I felt that this was very inappropriate considering the amount of detailed information we covered. I understand that it should be independent studying, but a general outline of the issues that she felt were important to look at would've been more helpful. On top of that, she instructs the entire class to create a 30 minute movie at the end of the quarter (in the weeks leading up to finals week, might I add) which I thought was a complete waste of time. With a class that large, a handful of students are bound to take on the vast majority of the workload, and I was unfortunately one of those students. It did not enhance my learning or understanding of the class in any way, shape, or form, and nearly every other member the class who I talked to felt this way. It really did feel like one of those high school projects that is just assigned as busy work, and especially during finals week it became very stressful. Imagine trying to coordinate filming schedules with 70 students in your class, and you can understand why this would be problematic, If you're very interested in MCDB, then take the class. The lectures are very well put together. If you're on the fence, or this class is not a major requirement, don't waste your time."

As you can see, this quarter we had no exams. Thus, this class was honestly pretty light and stress free. The lectures were almost all asynchronous (only four were live). The essay was a five page paper and wasn't too difficult. It was also graded very kindly. The project was a group project and also wasn't too difficult. You could honestly get away without even watching lectures in this class since there were no tests, but I still watched them anyway because they were actually really interesting to me. The lectures also helped out on the homework assignments (which weren't too long). Professor Lee was also very kind and responded very quickly on slack. She even raffled us $25 Amazon gift cards for anyone who turned their cameras on in discussion. Definitely take this class!"

Do not take it if you don't have a strong biology foundation. Not just high school biology, a really strong understanding of biology. The class material itself is extremely interesting, but you can't succeed if you don't have prior knowledge and understanding of complex biological concepts. Dr. Lee does not give any study guides or direction for the midterm and final, making it very difficult to succeed. When you reach out you are simply told to study the course material, but if you don't have the biological foundation this is extremely difficult. 
There is also one group project that the entire class participates in, making it really difficult to accomplish. With a group project in such a large class it's inevitable that the majority of the work is going to fall on a small group of people. 
Overall I enjoyed the material but it always felt like the class was working against me."
Peiyun Lee,Mcd Bio 50,"Stem Cell Biology, Politics, and Ethics: Teasing Apart Issues",Winter 2017,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 25, 2017",NR,"I enrolled in the class in week 2, as I needed a science GE that seemed interesting enough, this was one of the few that were still open, and your grade isn't entirely exam based. The class I was in before had a sort of questionable grading scale, it bored me, and it reminded me too much of the GE cluster I was in fall quarter that I ultimately didn't stick with. I didn't last the whole quarter, and dropped the class after doing poorly on the midterm.
I stayed for as long as I did because I thought the material was interesting. You learn about the science behind the stem cell research controversy. It deals with the anatomy of stem cells and how they naturally , different ways to engineer them, and their ethical implications. While I can't say the lectures are the most engaging ones I've been in at this school, they got the job done and explained the concepts well. You do actually have to go to them, though, because there are iClicker questions. Professor Lee is pretty friendly if you actually go talk to her and go to her office hours, and willing to help. But her office hours weren't at a very convenient time for me, so I didn't find that out before it was far too late.
As friendly and helpful as she appears in lecture, though, the class is not easy work wise, and I didn't know until after I was about to drop that it has a reputation for being one of the more difficult science GEs. There are group projects involved, though I didn't stay in the class long enough to comment on their difficulty or how they're graded, just that you work with the people in your discussion section. There are weekly homework assignments that involve designing an experiment, and they're graded on accuracy, but you don't get feedback on them generally early enough for you to learn from your mistakes and improve on them. You also have to write a paper, where you answer very specific questions about a book that you have to read on your own. All these things added together make up 55% of your grade, where the midterm is 20% and the final is 25%.
The exams are straightforward but rather difficult. They are similar to the free response questions on AP exams, only requiring a greater amount of detail and nowhere near as much practice material given out leading up to it. And as a north campus major who hasn't taken a real science class since high school, I was completely out of it. Neither she nor the TAs ever really went into detail on what to expect from the questions. But essentially each of them are based around one of the main ideas.
Bottom line: While I enjoyed my time in the class, I wouldn't take it again even if you paid me. Peace out, MCDB 50."

She is knowledgeable, super helpful and nice. I am a Business Economics major so I was taking this class just to satisfy a GE requirement but I ended up loving the topic. I have never been a huge fan of biology but the topic was really interesting and Dr. Lee made it even more engaging. The workload and grading is reasonable. This is actually one of those GE classes that you actually learn useful and interesting information without harming your GPA. However, keep in mind that the curriculum is based more on the biology side of stem cells and less on the politics."
Peiyun Lee,Mcd Bio 50,"Stem Cell Biology, Politics, and Ethics: Teasing Apart Issues",,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 26, 2021",A-,"This is one of the best classes I've taken, and by far my favorite I've taken at UCLA. I highly recommend taking this class with Dr. Lee, it's incredibly interesting and Dr. Lee is a lovely professor.
LECTURESLectures were held asynchronously for the most part, with 2-3 synchronous lectures. It was very nice to get to connect with Dr. Lee during these synchronous lectures, and helped restore the feeling of a normal class. For the asynchronous lectures, I typically just looked to the slides and took notes from them, going back to the lecture occasionally if an assignment question references something I missed.
DISCUSSIONSDiscussions were optional and honestly, I only attended about 3-4 of them (which I feel bad about because I really loved my TA). Typically we would just go over and answer questions from the readings and lectures that week and sometimes discuss in breakout rooms what we thought/answer questions the TA provided for us -- which we would put on a slide and then go over with the rest of the class/slides in the main room.
ASSIGNMENTS/READINGSAt the end of each week, there were assignments on CCLE regarding the class's content from the week prior (usually about 3-4 questions, as the quarter went on there would be less and less each week but the appropriate responses would get longer for each question). They were never too hard, could always be answered using the lectures/readings from that week and sometimes were opinion-based. I would usually just skim the readings and it never really caused any problems.
MIDTERM PAPERThis was no problem for me, just start early and address the prompt fully. We had about two weeks to do it, and I got a really great grade just from managing my time with preparing it and the content I included.
FINAL GROUP PROJECTThis wasn't too bad either, you and your group are assigned a degenerative disease that could potentially be treatable with stem cell therapy and you could make a poster, website, or a 15 minute video about the disease following guidelines provided by Dr. Lee. Compared to other finals, this was incredibly easy.
No tests or quizzes and an incredible manageable workload; I can't recommend this class enough. :-)"

It was both interesting and easy. Definitely attend the lectures, not only because they help for the midterm and final but also because there were interesting discussions and really cool guest speakers.A lot of points were practically given away, like clicker questions (just participation) and discussion board posts (sharing one article/post/question) a week. Apart from that, there was no weekly work. The readings weren't necessary for the class at all, but they were fun to read occasionally and might give you ideas for your paper.The midterm and final were straight from the lecture slides. Learn that extremely carefully. It might take 2 days for the midterm and the final. The midterm was more technical while the final had a lot more ethical questions, and if you prepare well, you can get above a 100% in both (she gives extra credit). The midterm paper wasn't too bad (4 sides) and this is coming from someone who hates writing papers. There was one group presentation which wasn't a whole lot of work.My TA (Devin Gibbs) deserves a shout-out, he was extremely passionate about the material and made discussions very interesting. He was also very prompt in answering questions.Overall, this class has practically no work on a weekly basis but does require extensive study time right before the midterm and final.

She is very particular about her homework so make sure you do not copy from anywhere. My suggestion would be to finish the homework before office hours so you can ask her for help. She is really helpful in that regard. The tests were not too hard as some of the previous reviews have said. The homework from the book though is a handful.

Dr. V is a kindhearted soul, don't get me wrong, but remote instruction has already fallen in engagement, and her lecturing even more so. I appreciate that she took ample time to explain applications of her material in depth, but when you're consistently 2-3 lectures behind in material, it's easy to be frustrated with the pace of the class. 
This class is very largely conceptual and application: take an equation, understand carrying capacity, population growth, etc. rather than ""find the derivative of this function"". The discussion (labs) are on CoCalc and you study Python. Pay attention to people introducing themselves on the very first day because you choose your own 4 person lab group, and you're with these people the rest of the semester. I was lucky to form very close friendships with my lab group, but others were not. 
We were not tested on coding, but had lab assignments due every week. There are pre-lab (highest grade) and weekly material quizzes (one attempt) every week. Homework is based on completion.

I think Dr. V truly cares about her students and their knowledge of the course. The quizzes are challenging, but she definitely does take into consideration student feedback and will alter them. Most quizzes and exams are multiple attempts.
Lectures:- Lectures are required for attendance (I'm pretty sure must attend 50% for full participation credit)- Lectures include polls that don't count toward participation credit- 3 hours of Lecture- These lectures mirror the textbook- Alan Garfinkel (the author of the textbook) additionally has videos which summarize the lectures as well - these videos are recommended but SUPER helpful.
Labs:- 2 hour coding lab (using COCALC/ Python)- The labs definitely require the full 2 hours to complete, but are overall straightforward. TAs and LAs are very helpful during coding sections, and will most definitely help you if you get stuck. - There are pre-lab videos and quizzes which are super simple and only take like 30 mins per week. These quizzes allow for multiple attempts
Homework:- The homework consisted of 25-40 problems per week from the textbook. The homework is mainly graded for completion, but if the answer is completely wrong I think 0.5 a point is taken off per question missed. The homework is turned in each week on Gradescope. 
Quizzes:- There are weekly quizzes. They are usually 10-15 questions and are based on the textbook/lectures- The midterm and final each consist of three portions. - The first is the creation of a study guide. For the study guide you essentially have to put examples or explanations for learning objectives. - The second portion of the exams are individual exams. The second portion is definitely the most difficult and consists of both multiple choice and free response. This second part takes 2-3 hours. - The third is a group exam, which usually has 3-4 longer questions. These group exams I did over FaceTime, and took 4-5 hours. - For most weekly exams/midterms/finals/group exams, Dr. V gives a 24 hour window to complete them.
- The final exam date/time you see on MyUCLA may not be correct as a result of this window. Do not be freaked out if you see a final scheduled for 9pm."

It's mostly busy work.Each of the quizzes were unlimited attempts, and some of them asked for your ""confidence"" in the answer so it was possible to get 300%. This is a great way to boost your grade.A few of the labs are a bit time consuming, but the TAs and LAs are very helpful and will help you if you get stuck.Both the Final and Midterm were split into three parts: A group study guide, an individual test, and a group test. the individual tests were a bit tricky, but the other portions made it really easy to get an A."

I resulted to reading the textbook and watching the videos in my syllabus which were super helpful.- The class is not all that challenging if you can teach yourself the information. There is a decent amount of homework but it is all due by Sunday so you should have ample time to do it.- The midterm and final got changed last minute to open note/open book with 24 hours to complete both which honestly might have made them harder. I didn't study a ton for either of them and because of that I ended up studying/watching videos while I took it, but it took a VERY long time. The midterm was 15 pages long and the final was 18. It is a good thing we had 24 hours because I spent at least 9 hours on each which sounds crazy but is true. - some of the homework isn't on things we learned about so... good luck and go to office hours. It is graded on completion but at least my TA was pretty nitpicky, so just be cautious.- the coding lab was actually pretty fun and relatively easy. We almost always finished everything in class and then would just review with a friend before they were due.- all in all it is pretty easy to get an A if you put in the extra work to teach yourself... she gives enough extra credit to raise your grade by 3 percent which makes a big difference.- Lastly, make study groups. I didn't, but really wish I had to bounce ideas off of and get help."
Sharmila Venugopal,Lifesci 30A,Mathematics for Life Scientists,Summer 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Oct. 2, 2020",A,"I think I skipped the majority of the lectures for this class. Dr. V is very kind but puts very minimal effort into her teaching. Lectures were so repetitive because she would essentially word for word read the textbook and only use examples that could be found in it. This was one of my first classes at UCLA and showed me why it is so important to read Bruinwalk! 
The course content is fairly simple especially if you have taken calculus before. I highly recommend reading the textbook as it is full of useful examples and was way more helpful to me than the lectures/ learning team support. Dr. V kind of forces you to lean on the textbook, GitHub videos, and TAs. 
My other tip is become friends with people in your labs. They are definitely manageable but get increasingly difficult as the quarter progresses, so support is key!"

Take it with this teacher if you want the risk of getting an B+ vs an A to an A-. You won't learn anything. The practice midterms were nothing like the real ones either (except 1-2 parts)

Her exams were basically a modified study guide, and the review sessions held by the TAs are really helpful because they go over answers and procedures for the practice exams. However, she is not very clear with her explanations in lecture and I relied a lot more on my TA than her when it came to learning material for this course. The only difficult part about the class are the labs, so I would get some people's numbers from this class to help each other out with those.

Dr. V isn't the most clear lecturer but it's not too hard to pick up on the ideas on your own. The midterm and final were pretty easy, and she offers two grading schemes in case you bomb the midterm. Overall, I would recommend this class with Dr. V. It's very doable."

I wish someone had told me these things when I enrolled in the class: GO TO OFFICE HOURS. She really clarifies a lot that she misses during lecture and she tells you whats covered on the weekly quizzes/tests during these sessions. They're held right after the class so its convenient to go at least once a week. The tests are really fair. Participation is not a huge part of your grade honestly and there is no homework. Labs are hard but collaboration is encouraged-so make use of that. Lab test is cheese. Easy A if you put in some effort. EC was offered my quarter.

Luckily, Karan, my TA, was able to really effectively and efficiently break down the concepts for us in almost a quarter of the time spent in the lecture at the start of every lab section. The class itself, on the other hand, is fairly easy and she does provide a solid good amount of extra credit. The tests are often easier than the classes taught by her counterparts and she doesn't collect any homework besides the labs, which are pretty confusing unless you have a really helpful TA. TLDR: If you're looking for an easy class and you can self-study well then take her class; otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it"

Not only that, but the questions that show up on the exam are also easy to solve because they don't ask you about the complex parts of a concept.

I never read the textbook once: just pay attention in class and do the homework and you will easily get an A. She is super funny and understanding also. The only bad thing about this class is the labs. The coding is so poorly taught (my TA literally didn't speak English so there's that). Luckily our test on the coding didn't get counted but otherwise I am not sure I would've gotten an A. This class would rock if it didn't have coding. It was miserable for everyone to do the labs each week and I am dreading them in 30B. TAKE SHARMILA! Seriously ignore the reviews on here. I had a conversation with someone in Garfinkel and showed them our tests and they were dumbfounded at how easy they were compared to the other professors. Our final was the content that Garfinkel's class had on their MIDTERM. We didn't even start any material until week 2.

Tips for doing well: Work in groups for the labs, as they are probably harder than the actual course material (but not actually that hard, TA's and LA's help, so it is more than manageable). Homework is graded for correctness, so make sure you actually go through it and think while you do the questions.

Conley is amazing, Garfinkel is amazing, and Jane (if she ever teaches LS30A) I'm sure would be fine for LS30A too since I heard great things about her LS30B class. Venugopal is horrible. I did not enjoy her class at all and regretted having to wake up for her 8am just to complete the clicker questions. I learned all the material by reading the book while taking detailed notes and watching a few of Conley's Bruincasts when he reviewed LS30A in the beginning of his LS30B class. I learned more about LS30A by watching 30 minutes of Conley's Bruincast than I had in weeks of attending Venugopal's lectures. Venugopal does not lecture the material well at all and she will not lecture a good portion of concepts central to the course. For some reason her LS30A classes are always at 8am and she will spend half of the lecture trying to review/reteach what she tried to lecture on the previous class meeting. She will not cover all of the material that you are expected to know for exams (she will put things you never discussed on exams, trust me) and will make basic concepts much much much more difficult than they need to be. This math series should not be all too complex as a whole....Venugopal somehow makes it so much harder than it needs to be. Homework is graded for correctness and it is graded pretty harshly in my personal opinion, Should you get lucky, she won't assign a final project at the end of the quarter, but with my luck she assigned it and it ended up being extra work that I had to stress about during finals week. She tends to change her grading scale. When I had her she did midterm 30%, final 30%, homework 15%, labs 15%, project 5%, class attendance 5%. The class really sucks but if you're willing to put in extra work on your own time to learn all of the material by READING THE TEXTBOOK without cramming the day before an exam (I also learned so much by studying tons of old midterms and finals), making sure that your homework is perfect or near perfect upon submission, and making sure that your labs are perfect or near perfect upon submission then getting an A shouldn't be all too bad.

She loves to use the iClicker for participation, and if you ask a really good question, it will be used as a class discussion.
The class concepts are not what you should be worried about because honestly, you should be good with a basic understanding of calculus. Beware of the labs for this course. The labs consist of computer coding that grows increasingly difficult as time goes on. Go to TA office hours as frequently as possible to get the best grade you can. Luckily, everything was equally weighted (20% for hw/midterm/lab, 30% for final, 10% for participation) so overall, it gave you good wiggle room.

Chandler's lectures were not Bruin-casted, so it made studying for this class challenging for me. I would definitely recommend recording the lecture if you can. Chandler provides weekly questions for students to work on, and he goes over them in his office hours. I highly recommend going over the questions carefully and really understand them because the exam questions are quite similar to those. The exam questions were all hypothetical and all short answers, so very easy to miss points here and there, which can add up to a lot. Overall, Chandler is an interesting guy and a good teacher, but the topic itself is just quite difficult and requires a lot of time and commitment to study for it."
Scott H Chandler,Neurosc M101A,Neuroscience: From Molecules to Mind -- Cellular and Systems Neuroscience,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 18, 2019",A-,"NO! NS M101A is NOT the hardest class you will ever take. And the curve DOES NOT start at B (like how some freshmen think). Actually, it's not hard at all when you compare it with courses like MIMG 101 or CHEM 153C. However, that doesn't mean it's easy to end up with an A. 
The problem is how module exams are graded. 2 of the exams are free respose questions only and space limited. You may have a perfect understanding of the concept and still get a low grade because your answers do not mimic the key. You mention a correct relevant point but take away no credit as the professor has thought of another point to put on the key. Regrade requests are not often appreciated.
My advice: be smart! save your commuting time and watch the lectures online (everything is Bruincasted). Instead, go to office hours so you have a better chance of reading the professor's mind during the test. Skip the text; won't do any good. Get your hands on some past exams if you can (they rarely change). Finish learning the material as quickly as possible so you can spend your preparation time on how to organize your response solving the practice problems. DO NOT lose easy points from quizzes and seminar write-ups (no excuse for that).

Scott H Chandler,Neurosc M101A,Neuroscience: From Molecules to Mind -- Cellular and Systems Neuroscience,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted May 10, 2021",P,"Everyone seems to love Dr. Chandler for some reason and I think thats because he gives off grandpa/dad vibes but in my opinion that doesn't really matter in a professor. Chandler was not a very good lecturer because his god complex consistently got in the way of conveying information in a reasonable and concise manner. You could ask him one very simple question and he would go on for 15+ minutes with some elaborate answer for the actual answer to be something as simple as ""the voltage decreases"" but you would get so confused as to why he was mentioning all of this arbitrary information inbetween (note- its to make himself seem and feel smart) that you wouldn't even get a useful answer or forget what you even asked in the first place. His slides don't have much helpful info on them tbh and in several places had contradictions. I will say though his exam was fairly graded, it was very difficult for me personally and I literally thought I was going to get a 0, and then I came out of it with a B- (which granted isnt good but compared to how I thought I had done). He also like lowkey sexually harassed a student in class once when referencing axon potentials in a metaphor where he said ""so and so, grabs my hot rod, because she's such a good student she does whatever i tell her too... and she says oh Dr. Chandler its sooo warm"" and then he literally moaned into the microphone. It was just more uncomfortable than anything else to be honest and I didn't really see how the analogy actually applied to the concept at all lol but aight man. Def go to his office hours and just voice record them honestly, discussions are useful if you have a good TA. goodluck"

A lot of the concepts are built upon chemistry and physics so having a strong background in those will definitely help in the class. Because the material can become complex and confusing at times, it's important to not fall behind in the class. That being said, if you're on top of your stuff, the module is very doable. Chandler is kind of a funny guy and cracks jokes and tries to make the learning engaging by calling on people that want to answer the questions he asks. It may not be the same way for future classes, but this was the format for the exam during online learning during covid: For the exam, it's all short-answer free response. The kicker is that there are 9 questions and you only have 1 hour to complete the exam; the questions asks very specific and complex situations so much of your time will be trying to understand what the question is asking and how you're going to answer. There is also a word LIMIT, so more of your time will be trying to formulate your answer in a way that is succinct."

Is he sometimes a crockety man who can only explain things one way? Yes. But also, his reader is everything you could ever want. The slides can only be described as if someone had 30 years of slides and tried to combine them all, but usually, they are helpful. His office hours are full of people who somehow still don't understand what an electrochemical gradient is and others trying to suck up, so I would say those are not worth the time. His exam did require you to think and know the material, but I think the problem sets and course reader were very helpful. Time was definitely a crunch. One of the TAs mentioned that we all got ""way too many points that were not deserved"" or something about Chandler's exam, however. Overall I think he provides you everything you need to learn the material, and in my opinion his material is pretty interesting."

Cannot stress enough how easy and flexible this class was especially when I combined it with two other summer courses (major reqs) and working a part-time job. Dr. Gorshein basically has everything laid out in the syllabus and there are routine discussion posts and quizzes each week relating to the screenings, reading and lecture. There is one essay in this class (~1000-1200 words) but you can write about anything theater-related and Dr. Gorshein is very helpful through the process. I ended up writing about Japanese theater and he gave me lots of resources to support my thesis. **also!! there are three different paper deadlines to choose from, all spaced two weeks from each other so you get to choose when you want to do it by. I chose the earliest just to get it out of the way** I really liked how quick the TA and professor would respond to emails and the quick feedback we'd get for our quiz, discussion, and essay scores. I have no regrets with this class and highly recommend. It was so relaxing and I actually did enjoy learning about theater with Dr. Gorshein."

David Gorshein,Theater 10,Introduction to Theater,Spring 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 15, 2020",A+,"I almost regretted holding off on taking my VPA GE for my last quarter as a senior, since it meant that I was taking 20 units. When I got into this class, it became no problem. The material was actually pretty interesting most of the time but rather intuitive so it was a nice break from my other classes. From what I gather, the structure of the class has been changing but has remained very chill. 
For Spring 2020, there were 9 quizzes, with the lowest score being dropped. The quizzes were worth 55% of the grade, so the best 8 were worth up to 6.875% each of the grade. The midterm paper was worth 20% of the grade. The final paper was waived and everyone got 100% for this portion, worth 25%. 
The quizzes would consist of mostly quick multiple choice questions and then 1-2 short essay questions, with a very clear rubric on how points were assigned for the short essays. I never lost any points on the written questions and they don't leave feedback, but am assuming they don't grade very harshly. The multiple choice and especially the T/F questions could be almost annoyingly simple - to the degree that it oversimplified the work. Just never overthink the questions. Overall, straightforward though. 
The midterm paper was very flexible, as he gave us three different options to choose from when deciding on a general topic. It gives you a ton of freedom to write about whatever the hell you want. I decided to compare video games to theater. I got a 97/100, zero comments once again. Literally got zero feedback from this class, but it was fun, and I didn't even have to take the last quiz which was great because some of the quizzes are double the length of others and it was nice to be able to drop the one quiz."

The final is all from them and the questions are super easy. Some discussion board posts will require you to reference a reading and the papers will ask for that too, but its super easy readings that you could literally just find one quote to use that is perfect.3.
I only watched 10 minutes of the first lecture, that's it. You literally don't need to watch the lectures at all. The final exam is multiple choice or true or false, it took me all of 4 minutes to finish, I probably could've gotten a 90% even without the class. The questions are that easy (what is an actor?, true/false a play has this character in it). There's weekly discussion board posts that, in my case were graded super leniently, I would put like 2-3 really basic sentences down and get full credit (possibly graded on completion). All in all, this class is super easy and super low workload. The plays are cool and some of the readings are genuinely interesting. Don't worry about the super long historical and factual readings, you won't be tested on them. We tested on 3 plays (all very easy reads), vocab, and like 2 articles."

Sander M Goldberg,Classic 10,Discovering Greeks,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 4, 2012",N/A,"I am a south campus major, and I really did not want to take this class when I signed up for it. But I ended up kinda, sorta liking it as the quarter went on. Professor Goldberg really is a good lecturer. Yeah, some of the topics were a little boring, as in any class. But the majority were actually pretty interesting even for a science guy like me. I'll spend alot of this review on the negatives, but keep in mind overall I did like this class.
Some things I did not like about his teaching style/the class:. 
-His powerpoint slides are really just outlines for what he is going to talk about; they don't help much. You really have to listen to him if you want good notes. Luckily, the slides he posts online after lectures are more detailed and are good study tools. Often, though, these are not detailed enough either and you must rely on your lecture notes.
-His tests are fairly difficult. Well, they're not really difficult in the sense that they require lots of critical thinking. They're difficult because he will test you on little details that you wouldn't expect (ESPECIALLY for the images, as people have stated).
-Didn't like how strictly fact based the tests were. They are just straight memory tests. No thinking needed. I don't think I thought once during his tests, except for the last essay on the final. Just study like hell the night before and regurgitate. Then forget everything. Many of the ""essays"" on his tests didn't even require complete sentences - just factual bullet points.
If you want an A, with minimal work:
-Write really good notes. REALLY good notes. Go to lecture everyday, focus and try to write down nearly everything he says. Yeah, it sucks to have to be so stressed during lecture, but believe me it will pay off big time when you are studying with really good notes. When images come up, write down every single word that comes out of his mouth - he will test you on the smallest detail you can imagine (I learned the hard way after the first midterm). 
-For readings: there are alot of these, he assigns a reading for almost every lecture and for every discussion. It's not THAT critical to keep up with the readings, except for discussion since you have to participate. He never tests on silly details from the readings, which is nice. However, you still need to know what is going on in most of the readings - 2 of the 3 tests had a quote section where you needed to identify author, speaker, and listener (thus it may be beneficial to actually read the texts rather than rely on online summaries). 
(Hint: he will almost always reference the readings in lecture, be sure to note when he does this). 
(Another hint: Don't waste your time with some of the very historical readings, such as the ones that describe battles. He will most likely never test you on these, and the lectures give you all you need to know.) 
-Essays: These aren't bad - one 4-page and one 5-page essay. You don't need to do any outside research - just be sure to get good quotes from the text that support your argument. I started both the essays on Sunday when they were due at Monday at 9AM, and got a 93 and 96. Not bragging, just showing that they are straight forward and not worth stressing too much over.
Should you take this as an easy GE? Yes and no. Yes, because getting an A is very doable if you put in the effort. No, because there may be easier classes out there. Your choice."
Sander M Goldberg,Classic 10,Discovering Greeks,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 3, 2010",N/A,"Professor Goldberg is extremely knowledgeable and I am sooo glad I took his course my freshman year. I decided to became a Classics major, and owe much of my success to him. With that said, he is NOT an easy professor and this class is NOT an easy A.
You have to go to each lecture and take very good notes. He is kind enough to post his lecture slides online (I really dislike professors who do not), but they don't tell you much at all. The first midterm will be a bit of a surprise, because it's harder than you expected. The exams and paper are graded pretty fairly, but you have to know your stuff.
There is a lot to be learned in this class. He throws a LOT at you. In my opinion, I learned more from Goldberg's course than any of my upper division courses. I recommend him especially if you are a Classics major (or thinking about it) or if you are an ardent fan of Greek history. If you are looking for an easy GE, this is not it."

The readings aren't that important, and his slide shows are worth a huge part of your grade. It also depends on the TA you have, their grading style on tests can make or break your grade. There were also two essays which were relatively easy. Overall it was an interesting class, but it's probably more work than you would expect."

More often than not, his lectures made me want to fall asleep. The class wasn't too demanding, but he tests on images that he's shown in lecture once for a maximum of two minutes. The material isn't that interesting and isn't presented well. Overall, I would suggest skipping out on this class."
Sander M Goldberg,Classic 10,Discovering Greeks,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Jan. 3, 2009",N/A,"Medium-difficult course. Not an easy GE, but with a little bit of effort you can get an A. I got an A-, but that's because I got 80% on my first midterm for not listing enough details. So pay attention to details! Lots of memorization. Reading is not essential, but it will help you remember the essential information much more easily. Things are easier to remember when they're coupled with a story. You really do learn a lot from this class if you try. It is essential to attend lecture, because all of his tests are based on lecture. There are two 4-5 page papers, graded by your TA. Section attendance is 15% part of your grade, so I'd say having a good TA would help. Andy Kinzler's a nice guy. There are 2 midterms and one final. Tests consist of different types of short answer questions and one interpretive essay. Pay attention to the images. Sometimes he posts his PowerPoint slideshows before lecture, so you could print those out and bring them to lecture to take notes on. But that's a lot of ink, so I'd recommend bringing your laptop and viewing the slides from there. I have lecture voice recordings and notes that pertain to the midterm formats. I also have reading notes, study guides, and practice exams. Email me at [email protected] if you're interested."

NEVER miss a lecture. If you have to have someone record it for you. All of his essay questions come straight out of lecture notes, and the rest comes from slide show. The readings were not much. For people like me who haven't had Ancient history classes before they were confusing as they went off to talk about the most random stuff.

He warns the seniors on the first day that the freshmen, who are still highly motivated, are going to do better than them. I don't know if it's true, but that's the mentality you need for the class. There is no central theme to the class, so for the midterm and final you have to know a little bit of everything- literature, law, architecture, art, etc. This information is often taken from material that was only briefly discussed in lecture.

Oh, and slides. Pointless, over-detailed slides. I thought I could coast through the first midterm with a basic overall knowledge of the history and literature and ended up with a B-. For the second midterm, I studied my butt off with a friend (which really helps for this class), knew all kinds of pointless, irrelevant facts, and got an A. I also got a 95% A on the final with this same technique. I practically cried. 
The tests are extremely specific. For the slides, specifically answer the given question and don't add anything fancy. For the essay and short answer portions, write down every little mundane thing you know about the topic, event, or historical figure. That's all that will get you through the unfair and subjective grading system. 
I recommend study groups and never missing a lecture, or at least getting the notes from a friend who can explain to you what you have missed. However, I would like to give it up for my amazing T.A. who made the class my favorite of the quarter (probably because it was the only one that really challenged me)."
Sander M Goldberg,Classic 10,Discovering Greeks,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 21, 2005",N/A,"There are definitely easier GE's out there than Classics 10 with Professor Goldberg. His lectures are mediocre and not very engaging, partially because of his voice and partially because of his style of presentation. He whizzes by Greek terms that will be tested on the midterms & final, so from the lectures alone, it's hard to know what he considers significant. This is when the online-posted lecture notes are helpful--they're there to fill in the gaps.
Honestly the surefire way of doing well in this class is to attend lecture and take copious notes on the picture slides. Those slides can really make or break your grade. If you miss a slide day, make sure to get notes from someone else who had attended lecture. His other exam questions are very straightforward, but the grading is a bit nitpicky for a GE [maybe that was just my TA]. 
The papers (2) were easy and relatively short. The reading selections were okay. I personally preferred the Greek literature aspect of the course more than the historical part of it, simply because it required less memorization. Unfortunately, this is one of those classes where you're required to memorize the timeline of historic dates and events. 
Overall I took this class as a break from science classes, and I came in with high interest in the subject matter. That gradually dwindled as the quarter progressed, but I made out with an A-. Average class, average professor, average TA. You should probably take Classics 20 or 30 instead if Goldberg is the professor for 10."

Yes he posts the slides and lecture notes online but the slides don't come with captions and the lecture notes posted are missing some crucial information. The lectures are okay, not overly exciting but pretty interesting. There are two essays in the class based on readings but they're pretty manageable. My TA was a total dooze though but since they grade your exams and papers and there is also a section grade; you should go to discussions as well.

He posts online lecture summaries which is great, and also he'll post slides online that you need to know which are also in the book His tests were pretty fair and the text book complements his lecture if you miss one or two. Again, it's really the TA who makes or breaks your grade and I ended up with an A- really because I discussed a lot in class and asked a lot of questions via email and in person to my TA about essays.Overall, I think this class was just okay, and if you're looking to do anything with classics (as I am) its helpful and I don't regret taking it."

One of the most important thing about this class is to attend his lectures--only way to do well in that class. The class's website is very helpful too, because he posts summaries of his lectures and some pictures from the slides that he shown in class. The exams are quite simple because they consist of slide i.d.'s, maybe definition, and very easy short answer questions.

The point not being his examinations are hard, but there is no easy way to improve your grade if you don't have a strong background. My physics 1C professor also had a ridiculously hard final and the median is comparable with Corbin's, but I did much better because that professor gave a lot of practice material very similar to his final, so at least me, not being strong in physics before taking that class, could practice on them and get familiar with how to do hard problems. This will never happen to Professor Corbin. There is only one guy I know of who has weak physics background but got a A for this class. Guess what he did? He did around 200 MIT physics hw problems and they are very similar to what corbin will give on his exams. So taking some other professor's 1B will definitely make your life easier."

It's a hard subject in general and I wouldn't consider myself to be especially good at it, and it probably did not help that I took this with all the physics major.Regardless, he gives a long list of recommended textbook problems that won't help you. The best advice I can give is to do some of them to get a good handle on the basic principles, but then try to find hard problems. If you can get some of his old exams that will really help, or maybe look up and do some MIT physics problems.All in all, he's very passionate about physics and a great lecturer, but I would recommend skipping him if possible unless you're really good at physics and/or don't mind a GPA plunge."
Brent Corbin,Physics 1B,"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields",Summer 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Oct. 10, 2020",A,"TLDR: If you enjoy physics and want to completely understand the different concepts in the class, I'd highly recommend Corbin. If you do not care too much about the subject and just want to get it over with as a requirement for your major, you're better off taking a professor who just uses formulas and asks direct questions in tests.
Corbin is an amazing lecturer with clear and engaging lectures. Attending office hours is tremendously useful as he covers a lot of examples. There is a lot of homework worth a total of 10% of your grade. 
I'd recommend making a cheat sheet for every chapter, using it to do homework questions using variables and not numbers, and then plugging in the numbers to check if your answer is right. This is what I did and felt like it gave me good practice.
The quizzes were of moderate difficulty and you can get away with one poor quiz. The final, however, was a different beast with tough questions. I fell short of time but the curve carried me to an A."

Brent Corbin,Physics 1B,"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields",Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 28, 2019",A,"The main reason I would recommend taking him above others is that his classes are pretty much always entertaining, In addition to cracking jokes, the one thing he does that I have seen no other teacher really be able to do is that he brings in many cool examples and anecdotes from real life that make the class just much more lively in general.
(For example, while he was showing the theory on how Faraday shielding works, he brought in some electrical thingy that made a static-y noise in the presence of unshielded electromagnetic radiation. He brought it close to his phone, and it started ticking at a very constant rate! He explained that this had to do with the fact that the phone is constantly sending out signals to try to communicate with nearby cell towers. Very neat.)
Combine this with a very flamboyant personality, a little bit (sometimes a lot) of cussing, and this means that lectures will almost never be boring, (even at 8 AM). 
However, this is where the good things I have to say about him end. While I mostly like his teaching style, his testing style is just a bit... mean. This is the only professor I've seen that's been able to make a reputation for himself outside of the classroom, and I was able to see why firsthand.
First off, I'll just say that even if it's as a joke, ANY professor that talks about how hard their tests are should be an immediate red flag. Heck, I'm still not sure why many professors even do this, but the reasons don't really matter. If you know the professor is making the tests hard on purpose, with intention, that's never a good sign.
I'll be the first to agree with what many others have said about the whole ""take him if you want to be challenged to grow even more"" stuff, which is that it's overall not true for most people. Even as someone regarded as a bit smarter than average throughout high school, I will say I felt pretty hopeless looking at the answer key to the midterms. He has severely damaged my own passion for physics, and undoubtedly for many others as well. He say the midterms are where you ""learn from your mistakes"", but what is there to learn from when you had no idea what to do in the first place? I'd love to go into more specifics but my resources are limited in a text-only review.
The final does seem to be a bit of a place to redeem yourself though, to me, it was quite a bit easier (with one problem being the exact same as an example shown in lecture), and it's worth more of your grade.
Either way, if you have already decided to take him, some more concrete advice: be prepared to study by just doing practice problems and examples over and over again. I'm tempted to say to make a list of the examples gone over in class and other good ones you find and just do them over and over again until you can do them perfectly without hesitation or even really thinking (it's what worked for me). It saves time, prevents lots of errors, and is often the basis for most of the tests actually. It lets you get onto the harder stuff on the midterms, which, I'll be honest, you can't really study for.
His office hours are fun and interesting where he talks a lot on how the concepts extend, but if you want more concrete practice for tests, go to the TA's office hours.
TL;DR - I overall recommend this guy as he is a great physics teacher, but be ready to study in a very particular way because he is not the best tester. His own office hours are interesting, but useless overall if you want to actually prepare for exams (go to TA OH for that)."

The physics postdocs, who are primarily doing research, teach the physics 1 series far, far better than this guy. This guy's only job is to teach, so its sad that he can't even outdo the overworked and underpaid postdocs. 
The so-called ""handouts"" that he occasionally uploads throughout the quarter are hastily written, short, and pretty useless. He may as well just not upload anything onto CCLE. He just lectures off the board and his lectures are very average. Office hours are so packed that often one cannot even see properly. His office hours are a real pain to attend. 
If you look at the grade distribution of other instructors teaching this class, you'll notice that Corbin's grade distribution is harsher. In other words, despite teaching this class in a mediocre fashion and giving tests too long to finish in the allotted time, he goes on to punish people with his curve.

In addition, I felt some questions were a bit vague, and you have to assume in what format he wants the answer sometimes which can be aggravating as it can lead to unnecessary point deductions. While Corbin does teach well, his tests can be extremely difficult, so for the average student, look elsewhere.

The quizzes are hit and miss; sometimes Corbin will prep you very well for an easy quiz, other times it will absolutely demolish you if you don't do the homework (and maybe even if you do). The final is just 5 quizzes back to back and requires god-tier time management in order to not end up missing loads of credit.

He is a clear and engaging lecturer and you can tell that he is truly passionate about the material. He explains the material in intuitive ways that help give students a fundamental understanding of physics. At times, the material may be dense, however, so I found it helpful to have read the relevant sections in the textbook before the lecture, even though they were never assigned. 
His tests and quizzes are very very difficult, and completing each question within the alotted time is a major challenge. You cannot simply memorize formulas to do well on his tests; rather, you need to have a solid understanding of the underlying physics, which can take a lot of work. He did curve the class generously (in part due to the challenges posed by COVID) which did counter some of these issues. 
Lastly, there was quite a bit of online homework for this class, but done over the course of the quarter, it was fairly manageable. DO NOT save it for the last minute, you will hate yourself for it. Furthermore, many of the homework problems were helpful in preparing for the exams. Corbin tends to not like if you ask for help on too many of these during office hours (attend these!!!), so save those for the TA discussions/office hours."

I didn't do 200 MIT physics problems. What I did do was listen, and I mean really listen, to every word this guy said. I went to every lecture and every office hour for the entire quarter. I did the assigned homework without looking up the answers online. I did a reasonable number of interesting outside problems I found (but definitely not 200), and read through some of the feynman lectures on the topics we were learning. I think because of it being online the curve was a little more lenient so take my grade with a grain of salt. That being said, I highly, highly, recommend Corbin. He is one of the rare professors that is actually intelligible and gives you a clear path to success. He talks about problem solving strategies (for example, when we did doppler effect he gave us a very clear surefire way to set up every problem which made them trivial), fun examples, gives great explanations, and takes doubts meticulously. Even though it was online, this class was a great experience and I feel like I really gained a lot from it. I am not a great test taker and his tests were very, very difficult for me but everything else made it worth it."

But they are harder than usual exams for sure. The exams are math heavy, and you want to memorize all trig identities and review multi-variable calculus. If your major is math-heavy, I'd say that taking Corbin isn't too bad. If not, (like CS), taking Corbin isn't worth your time unless you love calculus. Don't expect a generous curve though.
Corbin is an amazing lecturer. His lectures are articulate and engaging. Don't fall asleep in the lecture though, since you'll miss out quite a bit.
Corbin's ""homeworks"" are optional. I personally didn't do any myself and don't feel like I missed out too much. Work on the discussion problems instead, since TAs also write the exam. (the exam is similar to discussion problems). The textbook is really useless. 
And physics 1B material is surprising... crammable! All the concepts are based off calculus, so it's not too bad for cramming. Corbin doesn't allow any formula sheets so you have to memorize some formulas though. Understand what the differentials mean and practice integration.
But about grading... you really gotta hope you do better than others in the class. Practice taking integrals. (if you hate math, you shouldn't take 1B with Corbin). People did well this quarter so it kinda sucked. (Somebody got a perfect score on the final according to Corbin). Seems like that I'd have pulled some form of A if I took this a quarter earlier :("
Brent Corbin,Physics 1B,"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields",Summer 2018,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 23, 2019",A,Corbin is a really good professor and I gained a strong understanding of the subject. I took him in the summer so the class comprised of 5 or so quizzes and weekly hw. hw wasn't collected but doing it really helps do well on the quizzes. Quizzes were one question and were difficult but understanding the homework will help you do well. The final was pretty hard but as long as you are able to solidly answer a handful of the questions you have a good chance of doing well in the class. Only problem is that it really feels like he heavily favors the kids who always go to his office hours which normally doesn't matter but in a small summer setting gets a little annoying. Otherwise good professor and teaches well (which is all that really matters).

Corbin has an unfortunate tendency to interject irrelevant remarks into his lectures; whether these involve stereotypes, political commentary, or other non-class-related topics, these instances detract from the overall quality of the course, and leave something to be desired in terms of professorial engagement. He is extremely abrasive in person, and will refuse to accommodate students in any way, even going so far as to refuse to hand back midterms during office hours. 
His grading scheme is fundamentally flawed, as it presupposes that (almost) every single student will fail the course without a massive curve. Students will routinely obtain grades of 40-50% (on average) on exams, resulting in a curve being necessary to avoid repercussions from the department. 
I received a passing grade in this course, but would definitely not take it again with this professor. While he may be competent at teaching the material, his personality, overall teaching style, and level of engagement leave much to be desired, making the overall experience highly negative."

Based on the frequency of the drum on the way to the harp and away from the harp, what is the tension in the string?The takeaway here is that if you're in it to learn, this is the class to take.

He definitely has his own explanations on some physics concepts, and that really helps when you are learning because you could think differently. Take his lectures and read the textbook, two different pathways will always be better than one. He is a bit stubborn and always insists that he's right. I couldn't run his example code in Physics 105A on my computer, then I asked 4 of my classmates and they couldn't run it as well. But he insisted that there's something wrong about our computers. That's weird.In his lectures, he is quite engaged and will talk lots of his personal experiences related to some physical phenomena. I could feel that he loves physics a lot. Homeworks are neither collected nor graded. They will be assigned at the beginning of the quarter and are not so related to the tests. Doing them would definitely help you know the materials, though might not save you on the exams.Midterms are hard and I have to say that actually there's no way to prepare for it.

Brent Corbin,Physics 1B,"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields",Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 27, 2019",B,"While Corbin is an engaging lecturer, he is a bitter man. If you are fine with a professor who clearly does not like it when you ask questions, speak to him, or look at him, then still don't take him because it's just not worth it. Corbin makes his class hard so that many people go to his office hours(think 20 people in a small office) so he can inflate his own ego by artificially creating demand for himself.
Corbin will not give back exams in office hours, only before (8 am)lecture. And as someone who has experienced panic attacks, regular, quality sleep is an even more important element of my health. His inflexibility in returning graded materials is just one example of his lack of empathy towards his students. 
Corbin is short tempered and easily disgusted by interactions that come with being a professor. He will appear irritated and disgusted if you approach him or ask a question. He is excellent at making others feel stupid.
Corbin utilizes a flawed testing philosophy. His tests are 3 hour tests given in 50 minutes, and many of his questions require memorization of random information given in lecture(like the velocity of sound in a wire, or the solution to a forced, damped oscillator, or the solutions to the differential equations describing RC circuits). His tests highly skew towards memorization.
Corbin does not prepare his students for his exams, which contain problems 100x harder than any homework problem, and deliberately so, since he endorses this ridiculous testing philosophy when he says ""You need easier problems before you do the harder problems."" But this isn't training wheels, its asking someone to do a trick on a skateboard after they just practiced riding a sled. He never gives any problems or materials that compare in difficulty to the exam, and neither do the TA's. You must go to the review session graciously provided by Tao Beta Pi before each midterm if you want some examples of hard problems(maybe 3-5 given), or find someone with a test bank(which he is not clear about his policy on test banks since he has no syllabus). 
In short: Corbin is mean, clearly bittered by the annoyance of students over his many years of teaching. His teaching structure is designed to be sat through quietly while you grasp at straws, hoping to remember something for the ridiculous exams. He is just a waste. There is no reason to take this professor over any other, no matter what anyone says, your quality of life will be greatly improved if you take anyone else. It is a waste of human interaction on this earth to take this professor. And this is coming from someone who got a B in his class. It's just not worth it."
Brent Corbin,Physics 1B,"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields",Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 27, 2019",A,"Corbin's tests are quite tough compared to other physics classes; but if you look at the previous quarters, his grade distribution is quite decent, giving around 25% A's. The key to doing well in his class is going to lecture and understanding the concepts and math behind every single step of his derivations/examples; if you can do that, it's not too hard to apply the same thinking to his exam problems, which usually aren't too different from his lecture problems. Do the discussion/review problems from the TAs, and I'd also recommend looking at Corbin's old exams as well as some of the Feynman lectures. IMO, reading the textbook/doing the recommended HW problems is mostly a waste of time. If you work smart and reasonably hard, this class really isn't too bad, and Corbin does do a good job of teaching physics."

Brent Corbin,Physics 1B,"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields",N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Sept. 20, 2013",N/A,Seriously one of the best professors I've ever had. Genuinely interested in student learning and very approachable. Make sure you go to his office hours.
Brent Corbin,Physics 1B,"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields",N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 25, 2013",N/A,"This man is the best physics professor I ever met, and I am glad to see every review on this page so far agrees with me.
I took Corbin after having inadvertently sat through his 1B lecture by mistake during Winter (when I was still in 1A), and realizing he was the man I wanted for 1B. Why? Well, for a start, his lectures are phenomenal. That's a bland qualifier, though, so let me be more specific: this man is not afraid of using his head. He does not shy away from mathematics proper (something I have seen far too many otherwise well-meaning professors do, not realizing just how detrimental it is in the long run), and does not believe that a physicist is a human calculator (something I gladly welcome; physics is not arithmetic or ridiculous computation, and anybody who thinks it is is severely mistaken). 
In that vein, you will rarely, if ever, see him perform a calculation. What Corbin specializes in, and what makes him superior to many other professors, are derivations. Nor will these be ordinary derivations. For his final lecture in Spring, Corbin went so far as to derive the exact rate of precession for a charged sphere oscillating at an angular velocity around its axis in a magnetic field (which sounds complicated at first, but Corbin roots it completely in everything you've learnt over the quarter, so that when you see it, you'll kick yourself for not having thought of it sooner.)
Here's a list of what makes his classes unique:
1) He knows more than the book. He is not one of those professors who copies things wholesale from the text and proceeds to do exactly what's in it. Corbin teaches upper divs as well as graduate classes, and in his younger days worked at FermiLab, only the world's premier particle physics institute after CERN, and he brings all that knowledge to bear on the 1 series. He will correct the book on several occasions, teach you advanced stuff, and he will - I promise you this - make you like it, in part because he can actually make you understand and use it by yourself without too much help.
2) Corbin advocates self-sufficiency. He is one of those teachers who will go well and beyond the call of duty to make sure you understand what you're doing (he once let a struggling student actually bunk in his office in the days before the final to avoid distractions from studying), but his main intent and goal is to get you to the point where you could surpass even him. When discussing how to prepare for his midterms, he will ask you to go over your notes, and derive the equations firsthand for yourself. (I went even further, and came up with my own problems - it's really good practice, and will help you loads). He believes in this so much he even made the homework strictly optional: a lot of hard questions, and they're all upto you to do them - Corbin will grade you on the finals and the midterms only. Corbin also believes mathematics was invented for physics, and so it's physical intuition you need to hone - understand what's going on, and the math will work itself out, is what he always says.
3) Corbin is not, contrary to what everybody on this page claims, hard. If you actually go through his old midterms, you will be a little surprised to find they are all actually pretty straightforward - a standard Corbin problem merits no more than three lines of a solution (and if you think I'm joking, the solutions he hands out actually are just that long - that they also make complete sense simultaneously is simply proof that the difficulty of Corbin's problems are exaggerated). 
What makes Corbin legendary for his midterms are a combination of factors: the time limit (fifty minutes is just not enough to solve three Corbin questions), the fact that they test more than one concept (including quite a bit of your math - Corbin is particularly fond of Taylor series, and will have you employ them where you can), that he likes pushing you into unfamiliar ground (on his final, he asked us about semiconductor devices, something which we had never covered) while making you realise just how much of it is actually familiar (on the same question, he asked us nothing about semiconductors, but only gave us certain properties and asked us to work out directly from these properties the effect it would have on the rest of the circuit), and finally, that they're just completely new. It takes skill to solve a completely new problem, one you couldn't have imagined in your wildest dreams, in just fifty minutes. By way of comparison, if all you've ever learned is Euclidean geometry and trigonometry, you're going to have no clue what to do when you have to solve for things on the surface of a sphere, even though everything about such a problem can be solved using Euclidean geometry and trigonometry (no joke, that's how Carl Gauss, the greatest mathematician who ever lived, did it at the tender age of sixteen). Simply put, Corbin is different, not hard, and won't have you go through the material you've already covered and memorized and could do in your sleep if he can help it. 
4) Corbin is awesome at teaching. There simply is no other way to put it. Corbin is a man who likes stories, and for his part is an incredibly talented raconteur: no class goes by without him at least once bursting into some episode from his life that will make you laugh, and simultaneously cherish what he's teaching you. He makes those equations come to life, mainly because he is quite literally deriving them right there (no notes, occasionally from memory, but mostly just making things up as he goes along), and by telling you these amazing stories about the objects his equations describe that will make you in parts gasp, flinch and simply be left spellbound. There is magic to these objects, not rote - a certain splendor and sheer grandeur that many other professors seem to leave out. For this one ability alone, I rank Corbin above every teacher you might possibly meet in the Physics department.
5) He cares about his students. He is one of the few professors who holds office hours four out of five days of the week, responds to every email promptly and with incredible detail, tries to get to know them all, will never short-serve you on information, and will always, always, respond to your questions. Speak up in his classes; it's good for you.
6) His demo days are epic. Do not miss a single one: he showcases really cool stuff, and will do things you thought they only did in Hollywood.
7) Office hours are special. You can ask for help on homework problems if you want, but he likes using them to go beyond the stuff in the classroom. Expect to see problems beyond the standard of the textbook, and sometimes several days ahead of his own lectures. Also, pipe up with good questions. 
And that's really all you need to know. Your only problem may be that Corbin is immensely popular - lines stretch from his office to the entrance of the building sometimes, and his office hours are packed with people, making it hard to get a one-on-one session with him. He also knows when he has a really good TA with him. This TA will be your lifeline. Also, he - rarely, but still there - makes statements that sound confusing and mystical ('Energy is conserved, except when it's not!'), and - still more rarely, but nevertheless - this can get in the way of seeing what he means, for a short while. Lastly, Corbin is a ribald man: don't be put off if he curses or describes how he comes to create midterm problems in a haze of drunken bleariness. That's just the way he is: a man of personality."
Brent Corbin,Physics 1B,"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields",N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 24, 2012",N/A,"I had Corbin for 1A, 1B, and 1C. He's easily one of the best instructors I've ever had at UCLA.
Take Corbin if you REALLY want to learn physics. If you're looking for an easy A that can be obtained by memorizing a ton of equations and spitting them out on a test, then you should look elsewhere.
His tests tend to have low averages, but they really test if you know the material well or not. They tend to test deeper concepts, instead of just facts or simplistic examples. For instance, his lecture might discuss a simple mass on a spring for oscillations. The homework might ask about two springs attached to a mass. While his exam will go the next step, and ask about the movement of charge in an RLC circuit. While initially one would think that a circuit has nothing to do with mass and springs, upon further analysis the charge is oscillating in the circuit. 
His lectures are pretty good. He's reasonably entertaining; he makes a few puns here and there with varying humor rating. He introduces the material in a pretty logical fashion and he's pretty enthusiastic about the material. But most importantly he actually does the derivations on the spot. (Although occasionally he refers to his notes). He'll describe his thought processes out loud which makes it easier to understand what an equation actually means. Other instructors I've had do some textbook-like derivation with some lame examples that don't really give a good taste what an equation means, and what it can do.
He's got OH 4 times a week if you are confused. They're pretty helpful, as he'll try and sort out misconceptions you may have, and he'll also give out some other cool examples that are actually pretty interesting/pragmatic. Corbin is also pretty chill by nature, so it shouldn't be too difficult to ask him questions. Even if it's really really stupid (read: trivial), because I've asked him a boatload of ""stupid"" questions. 
If you're an EE, you should really take this guy's 1B course. It'll actually teach you electrostatics pretty damn well if you put the time and effort into it. So much so, that EE1 becomes a ""joke"" compared to 1B. 
As far as grades go, Corbin is one of the more difficult instructors at UCLA, but he's also not draconic in his grading policy. He's pretty fair, and understands that sometimes people have crappy testing days. He does give a reasonable amount of As/Bs out (and not too many Cs and lower). As long as you're doing 1 standard deviation+ on all the exams, you should be in the range for an A. (Don't quote me on that). The Final Exam counts the most for the class- if you haven't been doing well on the midterms, then you should be prepping yourself to murder the Final as even with poor midterm scores you can still get an A.
For reference, I managed to get an A in 1A,B,C and I can assure you that I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed haha. (Although I think I was lucky in 1C) So it IS possible!
TL;DR Classic dilemma that a college student faces: do I want an easy A, or do I actually want to learn the material? If you really want to learn, but still want a decent chance at an A (it's not really free) then take Corbin.
Also, for entertainment purposes, you should ask him about the Color Conspiracy of Muppets."

He'll help you figure out how to approach problems, and how to really think about the concepts behind what you're doing.
Choosing whether or not to enroll in Corbin's class really boils down to why you're in college. Are you here to take easy classes and get straight A's, or are you here to challenge yourself to the point where you can get the most out of your time here?

He explained the topics so thoroughly and had great concern for the students.If one student didn't understand something he would spend time on that topic till everybody understood it. I loved his class. I'm not a straight A student and I mostly get B's and C's. I got a B+ in Corbin's class by going to every class and office hours. Discussions were pointless, the TA was too smart for the class. Corbin is such an inspirational teacher than even students that get average grades try harder because Corbin puts in so much effort and time, you automatically want to do well for him. I learned so much about Physics and it prepared me for me EE1 class.Corbin invites his student to come back and visit him. Once a student of his, always a student of his.

The material for the course is difficult in general, but Corbin tries to make it click. I didn't like a few things about him. For starters, he seemed to have a clique of students that he enjoyed (those fortunate enough to be one of the ones to go to his workshop and office hours). I didn't think that was really fair. Some people cannot make it to either of those things, and he should not be giving what amounts to big hints and things like that for the midterm and final.
I also don't like how there is no homework due. This makes it really hard to keep up with the material. I do realize that that is my own fault, but still, it would be nice to have some graded homework.
The exams are very difficult. You must try to get as much partial credit as possible. It's nigh impossible to get a complete question correct. 
I realize that most math/science courses are like this, but if you miss part 1 of a problem, you miss the whole thing. And when there are only 3 problems on the whole midterm, this is frustrating."

Lectures were funny and informative. In response to the previous review, Corbin DID specifically tell the class to look over the diving board problem he did as an example during lecture. The rotating circular mass was basically the same as that problem, only in different form--Corbin went over torque, moment of inertia, and basically everything we needed to know for the quiz.
That being said, Corbin really cares about his students. He's in his office often and always willing to help you understand concepts you have trouble with. His quizzes and tests can be a bit more challenging than average, but also ""fun"" in Corbin's sense of the word and force you to extend concepts that you learned in class (or apply them a different way). Because of this, you'll understand physics much better than if you'd taken a class with just plug and chug problems on exams. Everything he tests on he covers in his lectures, so if you pay attention in class and do the homework problems you should do fine. The quiz averages for our class were around 50%, but Corbin curved generously at the end (well.. judging from my grade). If you do take Corbin, make sure you go over your lecture notes thoroughly; they'll really help for exams!"

Everything about difficult midterms and EXTREMELY low curves is true; we're talking less than 30% every quiz. I found Corbin frustrating. His lectures differ greatly from the book/ homework in that he only discusses extremely general equations, then expects the class to apply the equations to problems that come WAY out of left field.Example: first week was on oscillators, simple masses on horizontal springs. The quiz involved a ROTATING circular mass, suspended by two springs, of varying force constants and distances. WHAT? Unless you remember specific 1A material involving torques, inertia, and disreguarding gravitational force, DONT EVEN TRY to start this problem, Corbin didnt teach the class enough to even begin this mess.Unless you love forcing laughter at his jokes (which i'm sure many ucla students do) and kissing teacher ass with little to no dignity, you better at LEAST ""be a master of"" 1A before you take his course.But overall, if you suck up enough and go to his office hours you'll def get a A-B (mainly because the curve is a joke)"

The lectures are amazing and if you take notes you will be fine. I was one of those people who didn't take notes. I attended about 50% of the class but still managed to get an A by cramming the night before. All tests have one question that comes straight from hw which mean f you do the hw you are guarantied 30/90 points on the midterms and 30/180 points on the final. Keep in mind that the average the first midterm is about 40/90 and the second one 50/90. So over all I think he wasnt as hard as everyone makes him seem like. You will enjoy his class no matter what.

Brent Corbin,Physics 1B,"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields",N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 11, 2010",N/A,"Firstly, Corbin is very concerned about his students. He really wants them to understand the material and is very helpfulin office hours.(although it can get kinda crammed sometimes). He is also usually pretty friendly and easy to talkto, especially so if you make an effort to communicate with him. Corbin is the type of professor that attempts toreally get to know his students, and he will definitely remember who you are if you go to his workshops or office hours. However, occasionally he will give short, incomplete answers to your questions, but I suspect this is done to make you think more about the question yourself.
On to the teaching, Corbin is a very good lecturer. He excels at teaching students physical concepts and principles, and he presents the material in a very straightforward and accessible manner. I was able to understand everything very clearly and gain an fundamental understanding of most of the topics.
The tests. The tests were very challenging, and the means were generally pretty low (39/90 first midterm 52/90 second midterm). However, most of the questions were doable if you understood the concepts well and studied your notes thoroughly. (Good notes are essential in this class!) Also, the graders were very generous in awarding partial credit, often awarding a few points for merely writing down relevant equations for a problem. His grading system is a little vague though, and he doesn't really assign any letter grades to the midterms. However, he insists that you will get an A if you can show him that you really understand the material and have ""mastered"" it. 
Overall, Corbin is the best physics professor I've had so far at UCLA and I would definitely recommend him to anyone who genuinely wants to learn the material well."

Although some posts below mine deemed him as an incompetent professor, but he is one of the only professors at UCLA who cares. Don't get me wrong; I'm not one of the student who got perfect scores on his midterms. Both of my midterm scores were below average yet I would recommend him to ANYONE who is willing to get something out of a class at ucla. Yes, his tests are ridiculous, and yes, you will spend a couple nights worrying your life away about the upcoming midterms, but once you get to know him, you'll see why I got such mad respects for him. He is truly passionate about what he does and how it will affect his students. 
If you do decide to take this class, be sure not to procrastinate because like other physics classes, the lectures will go by prettyyy quickly. Memorize his notes and do what he does and you'll be good to go.

Brent Corbin,Physics 1B,"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields",N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted July 19, 2008",N/A,"Brent really knows what he teaches. His teaching style is particularly effective, because he moves through problems in a very logical method. He doesn't just finish a problem and move on, but he tries to understand the problem from the point of view of a student who is still in the process of trying to master the material.
Besides that, Brent is also very entertaining. He's pretty much a college student in the body of an old man. He's very approachable, and always willing to help.
While Brent is a professor who gives the appearance of being more difficult than other professors, if you put in the time and effort into his class, you can definitely get an A. Remember that the midterms, at minimum, are only a way of detecting your deficiencies. The final is the last test of how much you mastered the material. If you can do extremely well on the final, Brent will be more than happy to give you an A. You have to remember that his grading policy is that your grade will dictate how much you learned at the end of the year. That is, an A says you mastered the material. A B says you understand it well enough. A C says that you know enough to do all right in the next class.
People will recommend that you don't take Professor Corbin if you are concerned about your GPA. I think if you are open-minded enough about Physics and take a genuine interest in the Physics 1B topics, it will be a lot easier for you to get an A. This is definitely a class where you actually learn and not just sit, plug, and chug."

He is a superb teacher and a very reasonable guy, but he expects his students to be fully committed to his class. His weekly homework assignments usually consisted of about 15 of the hardest problems. His exams are notoriously difficult, and the material isn't so easy to begin with. Put simply, his class is tough, and you will definitely have trouble if you aren't serious about it from the beginning.
With that said, there are a few things that you should know if you do decide to sign up for a class with Brent. First of all, do not let his first week scare tactics get to you. He doesn't exaggerate about the difficulty of his class, but he does intentionally gloat about it at the beginning of the quarter to weed out students who aren't sure they want to be there. Secondly, partial credit is the KEY to surviving his exams. On all three of our exams, no one came even close to 100%. This is mostly because his tests (especially the midterms) are too long to complete in one hour. Finish one or two problems that you're confident you understand, and then use the remaining time to get down whatever you can for the other problems. The graders award credit for just about anything, even memorized forumlas. Finally, take advantage of Brent's daily office hours. He is happy to go over homework or even discuss potential exam questions. He is a really nice guy and he enjoys helping his students."

You feel like you worked for and earned your grade, which is how every class should be structured. He is transparent and he is just... so selfless, genuine, and amazing.

He cares about each and everyone of his students and is often available to just talk and vent which for a professor is quite rare. He is always quick to respond to any form of communication and will not hesitate to help you out no matter the situation. I was going through a very tough personal time because somebody in my family had gotten very sick and I had to become a caretaker and he was so open and so understanding, to the point that I honestly felt that he was worried about me and my well-being.
Regarding the class, the grading scheme is pretty straightforward. We have three exams spaced out throughout the quarter, each one is worth 50 points. He illuminates your lowest score which means you technically only need to take two of the exams to get full credit! This is extremely useful because he’s going to double your highest score and basically drop your lowest one so if you do bad on one test you don’t need to panic. He also gives a multitude of extra credit! I believe he gives around 14% extra credit which is just insane. The extra credit comes in the form of create a video submissions, Lecture attendance, discussion section attendance, BACON tutorials...Overall I would say that professor niche is great at explaining and great at giving each and everyone of his students the individualized attention and care that is often lacking in the online setting and also in big classes in general. I will say that his tests are very difficult especially when comparing them to other professors giving same similar class. It’s a little annoying because he does push you but he never makes his tests impossible and he offer so much practice materials and so many resources that doing well in this class is not difficult. You have to be willing to put in the time and effort but if you try your hardest and you do all the work you are guaranteed to succeed. (He also is incredibly generous with partial credit in his tests, so don’t be scared of them being slightly more difficult).
Overall I wish I could take so many more classes with Anish! I also have to take the chance and give a shout out to all of the amazing LA is for this class. They made this class so much better! They gave personalized review sessions and they also were always active on both group me and discord. It was so easy to have your questions answered that I truly never felt alone when studying. They also gave out so many synthesis problems that I honestly could not even keep up. If you have the amazing opportunity to take this class with this professor I would not think twice about it! He will definitely be one of the best professors you will have at UCLA!

While CHEM 14D covers a lot of material in 10 weeks, Professor Nag makes it extremely manageable:1) He Bruincasts all lectures and uploads all his notes, clicker questions, and PowerPoints to CCLE. Additionally, he provides handouts for every set of reactions in a clear numbered list which is extremely helpful considering by the end of the class you'll have learned/memorized 80+ reactions. The class is very organized.2) He provides tons of extra practice problems and posts their solutions to CCLE. These problems are made by himself and are extremely similar to his tests questions. For every week, he provides a weekly problem set, a discussion worksheet, and a worksheet specific to the new kind of reaction learned that week. This is in addition to the large review worksheets that are provided for practice before the midterms and finals. 3) He is incredibly approachable and readily available. In addition to office hours, Professor Nag uses an online forum for students to ask and answer questions. However, unlike other class forums that can feel like the blind leading the blind, Professor Nag answers EVERY question himself or at least endorses posts by students that answer the question correctly.4) He is genuinely just a nice guy.

In the wake of a global pandemic and soon, maybe even a nationwide race war, it seems like it would be obvious for all professors to be understanding of their students and accommodate them appropriately. Unfortunately, I have heard several examples of professors who have failed to do so -- but Anish was not one of them. Not only did he alter grading and testing policies due to the extreme stress that his students have been going through, but he also spoke to us on multiple occasions about how he knows these times are tough and is trying his absolute best to make them bearable. He was always quick to reply to an email and was amazing at engaging with the class. Anish was able to make a grueling organic chemistry class fun, which I give him the utmost respect for during such a tumultuous ten weeks. 10/10 take this class with Nag"
Anish Nag,Chem 14D,Organic Reactions and Pharmaceuticals,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 19, 2019",A+,"Chem 14D with Dr. Nag was a great experience and my favorite class of the infamous 14 series. I went into this class with no idea what to expect given that Dr. Nag was a new professor, but he quickly dissolved my fears with organized (albeit fast-paced) lectures, concise answers to student questions, and tons of practice problems and exams. He also posts all of his slides online and is very helpful during office hours. Regardless of who you take 14D with, it is going to be hard due to the sheer volume of material you have to cover, and Dr. Nag was no exception. The first midterm was pretty tough and the second midterm was a major vibe check, but thankfully the final was a little easier. However, Nag was very fair when grading the tests and even adjusted the rubric for the second midterm to be more generous with partial credit. He also gives out lots of extra credit in the form of showing up to discussions, clickers, and online homework, which helped me attain a far better grade than I anticipated.
You can tell from the first lecture to the last that Dr. Nag genuinely cares about his students, is passionate about teaching, and wants you to succeed. Success will not come easily, but if you practice reactions every single day and go to lecture and discussion, you will do well in the course. Take this course with Nag; you won't regret it!"

He acknowledges that this class is hard, and although his tests reflect that, he creates them so that they are fair and he is generous with partial credit. He also does a grading scheme based solely on your test scores, two midterms and a final, but you get to drop your lowest one at the end and double your highest. So if going into the final you have an A, you do not need to take it. He is also generous with extra credit, giving 21 points of it when the class is only out of 150 points total. I would definitely recommend using the campuswire and doing the discussion worksheets as they are really helpful. The Bacon Tutorials were interesting, but not too important for learning.

Although the scheme is made up of only exams, Nag gives A LOT of extra credit that can bump your grade up by a whole letter! Exams are timed (2 hours for the first two exams, and 3 for the final). Also, the lowest exam grade of the three is dropped and the highest is doubled. Professor Nag is such a compassionate professor who deeply cares about his students; he's one of the best professors at UCLA that I've had so far.

He will do anything and everything he can to ensure his students have all the resources they need to succeed. Our class had a chegg issue with the first midterm, but Anish handled it in the most forgiving way. His teaching philosophy is one to be adopted by other professors, especially in notably difficult subjects like ochem. He makes his tests extremely difficult, but grades extremely nicely – I kid you not you will get partial credit for anything. His grading scale was the most generous I've ever seen, and he gave a plethora of extra credit opportunities. He also incentivized improvement throughout the quarter, with different grading schemes in which better exam scores would replace previous scores. For example: I got a 68% on mt 1 (rip) and 96% on mt 2, which then replaced my mt1 score and allowed me to opt out of the optional final. All in all, after a not so great experience in 14D previously, Anish's class was something I looked forward to (even in the middle of a global pandemic and everything else going on) and ended up enjoying very much.

He always took time to answer any questions students had and never made you feel bad for asking a question everyone else knew the answer to. By far the best chem prof out there. If you are going to take any chem prof this is the guy to do it with. He really cares about his students and was extremely understanding, especially during this time (I took it during the pandemic at home online). He even provided us with memes during class!
The basic break down of his class for my quarter was this:100 points MT1, 100 points MT2, 200 points Final (if you were satisfied with your grade you were given the option to opt out of the final as well), but he also added in 80 points of extra credit, which meant that you could earn up to 20% of extra credit, and it was easy extra credit if you just did it. If you attended live lecture and discussion you received extra credit, and if you did bacon tutorials (which were super easy and took like 15 mins) you received extra credit. Anish also likes to make his class fun so students can create a funny music video about the class and receive extra credit. 
The midterms were actually very challenging in my opinion, but he is an extremely lenient grader. He always says that he creates hard midterms in order to challenge us and to get us to actually learn and so he rewards us very generously with a lot of points for just attempting the question bc he doesn't believe we should be penalized for trying. For example, for one of the synthesis problems, I did the question completely wrong, but used the right method, and got half of the points for that question.

You can tell that this man loves what he does when he gives his little speeches about how each student should feel proud and confident in their abilities. A student would, for instance, write on campuswire about how nervous they are about their test or how they performed badly and Professor Nag takes his time to write a LEGIT PARAGRAPH about how to never underestimate what each student is capable of and how he is proud of all of students for trying their best. He always said that if you try your best on the exam then that is all he can ever ask for. He is extremely lenient on grading even though his exams may be difficult. I have never been pushed so hard in a class before and honestly, I did not think that I was capable of handling all the workload that comes with 14D but Professor Nag truly pushes his students to their full potential. I feel as if he's not only a professor but he's a great man with great intentions and passion for what he does. I want nothing but the best for him. He not only pushes his students to their best academic level but also teaches his students about empathy and compassion for one another. He is a professor that teaches his students about the hardships of life and how to overcome them. I love Professor Nag and although this class is very difficult, it is very rewarding in the end.

I walked into this class a bit scared about learning 14D. I heard that it was a tough topic and was hoping to not ruin my GPA. However, a tough topic does not merely dictate your grade as much as a professor. I can confidently say that Professor Anish is amongst the reasons I got my grade. Yes I studied for many hours, did practice worksheets, and spent a considerable amount of time learning, but it was his teaching philosophy, openness, and sense of understanding that guided me and so many others to success. I like to think of his class as a ride through the jungle. The jungle is confusing and scary but if you have a guide that knows it inside out and is willing to walk with you every step of the way, then you'll be fine. Lets talk logistics:
Note: The class was online due to the pandemic so the syllabus may be adjusted for in-person. 
- Discussion, attendance, and music video submission were extra credit. Professor Anish also provided EC questions on the exams. This EC was a life-savior. - There were also weekly assignments on BACON which were EC. I think total EC was around 10-15% (The class is difficult and EC is a must)- There were 2 midterms and a Final. O-chem builds off itself so expect each subsequent exam to be cumulative (25%, 25%, 50% respectively)
All in all, if I had the chance to go back, I would take Anish again. He cares about your grade and most importantly, your well-being. He wants you to learn and appreciate the complexity/beauty of O-chem but also is understanding of our difficulties. He takes time to respond to students and their concerns individually. God bless that man's soul."

I never thought I would be sad to finish a class, especially one like this with all the 14D horror stories you hear, but I was actually sad when he finished his last lecture. All the man wants to do is help you. His lectures move quickly but they're very clear and he lays out everything you need to know. He gives his students so many practice problems and posts old midterms to make you feel as prepared as possible. He gives out SO much extra credit. Like other people have already mentioned, this is fundamentally a tough class and the exams are challenging by design, but Anish gives you all the materials to be able to do it. As a person, he is just so genuine and caring. He was accommodating to everyone's situations and adjusted his already generous grading scheme to help us even further. He answers emails quickly and always gives helpful advice, whether it's related to the material or not. He's so personable and I have so much respect for him. I can't say enough good things about this man. If you have any opportunity to take any of his classes, do it."

He shows that he genuinely cares about student learning and mental health. Due to the COVID-19 situation, he made the first midterm 24 hours. I found it to be challenging and thought I failed at first, but the way he grades is a godsend. He gives partial credit for breathing. After a cheating scandal with Chegg, he gave the second midterm a 3.5 hour time limit, but made the exam much shorter than the first. I thought it was a fair test, and again he came through with partial credit. I did not take the final exam as it was made optional because of the unique circumstances, but he did say that he took all questions from previous worksheets so it was an easy test.
The class grade is made up of the exams, 25% for each midterm and 50% final. He offers TONS of extra credit through online tutorials, making a music video, ""for fun"" questions at the end of exams, and attendance. All of the extra credit adds up to like 12% of the grade, so it's possible to get over 100%. He even makes it so that if you do 10-20% better on the second midterm, he will drop your first midterm score (same deal with second midterm to final exam improvement).

The lectures are unparalleled, there wasn't a single moment when I felt either bored or not being able to follow what he was doing. He is really funny as well which is always a plus and makes o chem relatable and enjoyable and honestly by the end of it all I was kinda hooked on o chem which is shocking to me! Chem 14D is quite different from Chem 14C. This class is the nitty gritty of o chem and relies heavily on memorization. 14A-C are primarily about concepts and problem solving, but 14D by its very nature is memorization applied to problem solving. And if you put in the minimum effort and have a strong memorization game, the problem solving aspect of it is more fun than any other lower div south campus class by far! That's where Nag's brilliance lies, he showed how much fun it can actually be to master this subject and become good at stringing together like the 100 odd reactions to solve a problem that would have seemed impossible at first! The exams are tough, but the grading curve was so generous because Nag honestly just cares for us and he wanted us to learn and succeed at the same time. I mean both the midterm averages were around 75 which is EXTREMELY fair in a STEM class. Besides his grading scheme in general, all the extra credit he offers, his lecturing style and personality, and the fact the he would in all likelihood get to know you and become your friend by the end of the 10 weeks and give you a broader perspective on life in general, all makes Professor Nag one of the best and if you don't take a class with him, you are missing out!"

There are weekly worksheets in discussion that review material in class, but that is not all, Nag posts a crazy amount of additional problems that cover and recover ever aspect of the class. You will never feel as though there wasn't enough practice or resources. Even for the midterms and finals several forms of practice exams are created and posted well in advance.
Don't even get me started about the amount of extra credit in the class - Nag offers so much because he understands that it is not an easy class and understands Pre-Meds obsession with doing well, and he wants to see all his students succeed. Granted, his exams are not easy by any means, but they're not ridiculous and unfair either. If you study, do the practice, and memorize reactions they are more than fair. They do challenge you and require some intense brainpower, but he doesn't throw anything you've never seen before on the exams. There are small nuances that you need be careful to catch while testing, but if you prepare they are so doable. Plus, since the exams are slightly more difficult Nag scales them so generously to the point where several students were earning above 100% on Midterm 2.
Overall, Nag is a really really great professor and overall cool guy. He is one of the only professors I've had that genuinely cares about his students and is receptive to students' concerns and feedback. He made an effort to learn every student's name, and he practically did. He has faith in us and I've almost cried several times in lecture because of how nice his pep talks were. I hated 14c and ochem before this class, but now I love it. If you can, do yourself a favor and take 14D with Nag:)"
Anish Nag,Chem 14D,Organic Reactions and Pharmaceuticals,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 19, 2019",A+,"Okay where should I even begin. First off, Professor Anish Nag is hands down the best professor I have ever encountered at UCLA! And all I can say is my standards for UCLA profs have now been set really really high thanks to him. He is dedicated to the students and goes above and beyond really to ensure that you not only do well in the class, but actually learn and enhance your problem solving skills. He designed the class in a way that basically ensures that you have to apply your best abilities to do well. But the thing that really sets him apart from other professors, is his empathy! He will know and check if you are struggling and he will put in extra effort for you if you go and talk with him during or outside of office hours. He is also by far the most approachable professor I have met, who will never judge you for any questions/issues you bring to him but instead would just try his best to help you! To say that he is the most caring professor ever is truly an understatement, and that in itself should wrap up this review!
But to go more in-depth with the actual class and lectures, it's true that the class is really really tough. I mean it's real o chem and o chem means a lot of different reactions/mechanisms, most of which you have to memorize. There's really no way out of this, and that's what gives o chem all the bad rep that it gets. Having said that though, I never for once (maybe once lol) thought that the challenge of mastering all of these reactions was too daunting or impossible, thanks to the constant encouragement of Anish and his clear and informative lectures and all of the materials that he puts up on CCLE. Trust me, he puts up a LOT of materials and you will NEVER be short of having practice problems to work on! And it really helps a lot. His exams are challenging to say the least, but I think I understand why they are made that way to ensure that we give our very best effort to actually apply ourselves. But irrespective of that, he always has your back like no other professor does, and if an exam (like Midterm 2) was extra challenging, he sets a generous grading scheme so that you feel better and less stressed when you see your score. Oh did I mention he remembered all of our names (without even actually having spoken to us in office hours)? How crazy is that?! Almost 300 names which he would freely call out in lecture anytime somebody raised a hand to ask him a question or approach him in person. Like that makes you feel like you matter to him, and he is as much in this class with you as much you are with him. The man was even PERSONALLY PRESENT and helped out each and every student who went to the LA review sessions. No other professor has ever been so caring!!
Overall, I would highly recommend Anish! If you want to learn about o chem, if you want to boost your problem solving skills or if you just want to learn more about life and be ""a better human being"" each day (or just get an A at the end because most likely you will), take Chem 14D with Professor Anish Nag! Professor Nag if you read this, just wanted to say thank you for everything!!"

Anish Nag,Chem 14D,Organic Reactions and Pharmaceuticals,Winter 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 12, 2021",A,"I have mixed feelings about this class. On one hand, Professor Nag gives a lot of practice material and problems to prepare you for the exams. The discussion sections are quite helpful and the TAs and LAs are all super kind people. Most notably, this class is very heavy with extra credit and you can drop your lowest exam.
However, I had some issues with this class. Professor Nag often wasted the first ten minutes of class with chemistry memes that made the rest of the class seem super crammed. He would go over really complicated topics super fast, and didn't use slides. It seemed liked he focused more on getting us to like him rather than teaching us the material. I ended up having to rely on discussion or outside sources to help me learn the material.
Moreover, the tests were unnecessarily difficult. I think Prof. Nag enjoyed watching us complain to him how hard the tests were. He was apparently upset that the average score was too high for the first midterm. He made the second midterm much harder and sent us an email about how we may have thought it was the hardest test we had ever taken, but he said he thought it was easy. It felt condescending and made me feel really bad about myself after I had studied so hard.
At the end of class this quarter he ended class by telling us to leave him positive reviews on Bruinwalk, and then proceeded to email us the same thing. It felt really superficial to me how he is trying to use us to boost his ego. 
Overall, I would still recommend this class, but don't expect it to be easy and be critical of the rave reviews (because he made people write them). It starts out not super hard, but once the first midterm hits, the honeymoon phase ends. The extra credit and exam drop policy ultimately made the class for me, but his ego and hypocritical attitude made me not love the class as much as I could have."

this man cares SO MUCH about each of his students, mentally/emotionally/academically/etc. He puts in 110% to make class fun, informational, digestible, and organized. 
This class is by no means easy and you should definitely study every night a week before an exam (it's the only way to actually absorb everything and get an A, trust me). 
also: a passing grade is a 30%, so it's really impossible to fail the class, which takes a lot of pressure off of exams, participation, etc. The highest exam score is doubled and the lowest is dropped, so most students didn't have to take the final (this is not just a pandemic thing, I think it's Nag's policy in general). 
the LAs made this class bearable and dare I say it... fun? shoutout to LAs Porus, Mahir, Kulveer, Arif, Arman, and Nada for being amazing teachers and support systems throughout this whole quarter of 14D. 
I would 100% take this class again with Nag, he gives so much extra credit, was super funny and relatable, actually cared about us, and if you're premed Nag gives little tips here and there on stuff that is usually tested on the MCAT. stellar class , stellar prof, had a stellar quarter. :)"

Spoiler alert: he totally is. Not only does the guy present organic chemistry in the most straightforward way possible, but he also makes it impossible to fail with the amount of extra credit he gives. And his motivational speeches? Amazing. Know that while ochem is difficult, if you push yourself just a little bit, you can accomplish far more than you thought you could. Do the practice problems as soon as you learn the concepts (there is no shortage), rewrite and summarize reactions in your own way, and DO. SYNTHESIS. Synthesis can be the hardest beast for some people, but it's actually super fun when you have a good grasp of the reactions, because then it's just a puzzle! Also, the LAs for this class are the absolute GOAT, I swear they are a different breed of LAs from any other class you'll take. Nobody in this class wants you to fail, and the LAs and Nag have your back. Take 14D with Nag. Do it!!!!!!"

Took it with Pires the first time, BIGGEST MISTAKE I'VE MADE AT UCLA. If you are bored with Khankan, oof, try taking 7A with Pires, you will die of boredom (quite literally). But with Khankan, man, she actually makes me want to pay attention, she is extremely helpful and quite funny at times. She brings so many positive vibes to the classroom and tries to work with what she has. The class is not as easy as others but that is simply due to the LS department itself, which professor Khankan has no power over. Professor Khankan makes it so that you are not afraid of questioning things and making your own questions, to her every question is a great question. I would definitely take a class with her again. 
Aside from the professor, the class itself is structured in a way that makes you struggle. There is no practice exam questions or anything that is LIKE the exam. The launchpad questions are a breeze compared to the exam itself. The exams are more structured as a ""What IF?"" and not a ""What is"" type. You really need to analyze all possible scenarios that could happen if things are missing in a certain part of a process. Some questions are really confusing because they are given as statements rather than as questions."
Rana Khankan,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 29, 2020",A,"Prof Khankan was seriously a lifesaver for 7A. The material through launchpad is super dense and sometimes difficult to understand and apply, but Dr. Khankan does a great job explaining the topics and applying them in clicker questions. She's super funny and comes up with relateable examples to demonstrate and remember certain things. I honestly don't think I would have had such a good experience (considering the course) with any other professor, and I wish she taught 7B as well. To do well in the class in general: 
DO ALL THE EXTRA CREDIT YOU CAN. The extra credit points throughout the quarter let me prorate the final, which I was definitely not in the correct mindset to take with everything else going on this quarter. 
Do the launchpad. Some people can get away with not really reading through it, but for me, I read the text and took good notes every week, and it honestly helped me learn a lot. 
For exams: all you need for prep is to go through the learning objectives (I like to write them) and the clicker questions again. If I have time, I like to go through the lecture slides too since sometimes there's some niche topics that'll pop up on the midterms."

She is really good at explaining concepts and clarifies any questions you have. Before each exam she held on the hill office hours at like 10pm which I appreciated very much. The class itself is a lot of work depending on the type of student you are. For me, I need to read and review everything because I won't get it on the first try. I took a fair amount of notes on launchpad, reviewed clicker questions, went to PLF sessions and CLC sessions which made me succeed in the class. Exams are all application type questions so when she tells you to understand the concepts instead of memorizing small details, she means it. Would take her again."

Rana Khankan,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Winter 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 29, 2021",A,"Professor Khankan is a great and engaging lecturer. This is most evident when our lecturer switched near the end of the course; you truly realize how interesting she can make a long 1hr 15min lecture be in comparison to others. The lecture slides aren't very content heavy, and I didn't bother taking notes over them. The most effective method I found is to thoroughly read and take notes over the Launchpad readings before lecture, and have the lecture serve as a content review. Professor Khankan's lecturing is very clear, well organized, and engaging. 
While I have the same complaints about wording and typos on exams, since the department and not the professor makes the exams this is essentially out of her control. However, the exams are still fair, and everything we have been tested over has been covered in either Launchpad readings or in class. I had no problem with time on the exams as well. There is a lot of content covered in one quarter, so I highly recommend that you stay on top of things and not fall behind.
You can tell that Professor Khankan cares greatly about student learning. She holds office hours four times a week, three of them are content office hours and one is for non-content office hours which is a great opportunity to chat with her and get to know her. During office hours she answers any and all questions very thoroughly and clearly to her best ability. Overall the LS7A class may have some flaws, but I highly recommend you choose her as your professor if you get the chance."

Obviously, the material is very difficult, and you have to put a lot of work into LaunchPad for a good grade. However, Dr. Khankan was a great professor! Her lectures are fine- there's just a lot of participation. Take every extra credit opportunity, as you never really know how you're going to do one the exams until afterwards. There's 2 midterms, 1 final, but a lot of your points will come from LaunchPad, Clickr questions, and the worksheets you do in discussion. Make sure you do LaunchPad on time before every lecture, even if you just click through it and go back later. I had my discussions with Sean, who wasn't very helpful, but my LA was great. It's important to get 100% on every worksheet in discussion, but it usually wasn't too hard, since Sean went over each question before class ended, and usually there were smarter students enrolled that could help. Attendance and participation is very important, but Khankan allowed you to miss up to 2 lectures, since the points were out of a smaller amount than the max. I really appreciate Khankan now, (end of winter quarter 2020- Corona), as she and all other classes have allowed us to prorate our final scores, instead of taking it online at home.

Also, the CLC sessions are pretty helpful so try to go to those. Discussion sections are just worksheets but help you master the content. Honestly, everything designed in the LS series curriculum is pretty well done except for the fact that there is a lack of practice exams and problems. I know that there are clicker questions but it would help if they gave everyone a practice exam so students know what the format of the exam is going to be like because you kind of feel blindsided your first midterm. Just know that it is more application than memorization in the course and that this is a weeder class so some of the questions aren't even testing your knowledge but just whether or not you see what they are trying to test. So don't be discouraged even if your first midterm grade is low. And also, don't go to the TA Sean's office hours - his attitude is super standoffish and asking him for explanations of midterm problems made it seem like him doing the students a favor. He literally told me, ""I don't know. I didn't look at the midterm beforehand. I don't know"" and also, ""if it's a true false question, then why are you asking me, you already have the answer"".

Launchpad is good to learn a vague background about the material, but after that, it's irrelevant. Do not use it to prepare for exams, it will be a waste of time.There are four things you should care about when studying for a 7A exam: lecture slides, iClicker questions, Discussion section handouts, and the handouts given in class. That's literally it. If you understand the concepts given on these, there's no reason why you should't be able to get an A in this class. These specific materials help familiarize you with the types of questions that appear on a 7 series exam. I got high A's on both of the midterms by studying the material listed above and rarely ever doing launchpad in depth. I feel like people who don't do as well place too large of an emphasis on launchpad.

Yeah, this class is hard. This quarter, the class was taught by two professors, Maloy and Braybrook, but from what I saw Maloy teaches most of the content. Both professors were good lecturers, they had an abundance of office hours during the quarter and before tests. Lecture structure is a lot of active participation, and the iClickers are a big part of that. During lecture, there are a lot of iClicker ?'s, and you are expected to work them out with the people around you because they can be quite challenging at times. If you don't like to participate and the TA's see you, they WILL come up to you and challenge you to work out the problems with them. You're not safe anywhere, even in the back of the classroom sitting on the floor. Once, when Braybrook was lecturing, Maloy was going around and caught a bunch of us in the back not actively participating. He worked with us for the rest of the lecture, making sure we knew what was going on. While it can be annoying, especially because my lecture was at 9am and I didn't want to be doing anything at that time, it is really nice that the professors and TA's/LA's are so insistent. It makes you feel like they really care that everyone is getting the most out of their lecture time. 
DO NOT DISCOUNT THE IMPORTANCE OF LECTURE. Go to all your lectures!! As you may have read/heard before, launchpad kind of sucks. It's good for background info I guess, but the professors are really going to let you know what you need to understand from launchpad. And what they talk about is what's on the tests, in excruciating and often confusing specificity. Take advantage of study sessions hosted weekly by your LA's, I never went (my bad) but I heard they were super useful for practicing how to answer the questions as they are formatted on the tests. And they're formatted wack af, so you need the practice.
Don't fall behind, try to work with others as much as you can, and by God, take advantage of the resources they give you in the form of office hours and study sessions. If I had done all these things, I probably could have gotten an A-, or a solid B if I tried a little more. This class is honestly really difficult, but it can be easier if you don't fuck around and actually focus. These professors aren't dicks, they want you to succeed. So good luck and happy studying!

The exams were difficult but fortunately, the exam grade is based on the average of the individual phase and the group phase so even if you didn't do so well on the individual art you still have a shot at a higher grade. Launchpad can be super boring and overwhelming at times but if you don't wait until the day before to do it all it's ok. But yeah do take this class with Maloy if you have the opportunity to!"

He posted the slides before class time, so, you were able to review them. He does have clicker questions during class, but they are not graded based on accuracy; they're based on completion. I think as long as you did 70% of them you would get full points. In the quarter I took him, he offered 12 points of extra credit. The homework was on launchpad. Some weeks there was a lot of reading, some weeks it wasn't too bad. We had 2 midterms and a final exam. Maloy hosted 2-3 review sessions before each exam and they were very helpful. I would take him again."

Maloy does his best to help each student learn the material and always makes himself available to answer questions and help clarify the material. He emphasizes group work and has his students participate in after class group activities and group phases of exams (which usually help your grade). On top of this, for my class he collaborated with Dr. Braybrook to host pre-exam review sessions and in order to help answer questions in the chat. Overall, you definitely have to put in some effort to do well in this class, but more than enough resources are provided for you to do so."

However, I don't like the flipped classroom. You have to tons of reading of the textbook after class, and during the class, you are supposed to know everything and should start to solve problems. Not funny. Also, this professor can really zheng huo, meaning he creates various assignments for you to finish and submit. Learning pod, discussion worksheet, iclicker question (if you are at a different time zone, you need to do the makeup questions), Launchpad assignments. Launchpad quizzes... Just too many things. Easy to miss one or two (it's ok to miss only one or two tho). I should also say you should definitely not try to choose LS7A to fulfill your GE requirement if you did not take AP Bio or AP Chem or something like that."

He teaches this class super well and really gives students opportunities to succeed. His lectures are engaging and definitely help you prepare for the exam. Whenever you are confused, going to his office hours will definitely help you in your studies. I will say that launchpad, the book we read, is fairly tedious and kinda annoying to read, but definitely read as he might not mention everything in the reading during class. As for the content, think of it as AP bio but buff as in it is AP biology that goes into a little more detail on certain cell processes, but not too much detail. Studying advice: don't reread launchpad. Instead, look at the clicker questions, questions we answer during class and attend problem solving sessions, sessions where he reviews questions that will be similar to ones on the final. I should also mention that this class is super application based. Memorizing every little detail will only get you so far, so you need to be able to apply the knowledge that you learn during class to certain situations. The most common example is, ""if one part of a cellular process stops working, what will happen to another cellular process?"" Overall, would 100% recommend taking LS 7A with Professor Maloy, no matter what! (Note: this class for me was taken online because COVID was a thing)"

His class is not too difficult and his lectures are very participation heavy so it's hard to fall behind. We used iClicker (an app and website) to replace actual clickers and we still use Launchpad. I found the Launchpad assignments to be mainly busy work but there is a lot of information in the book. The exams were really easy because of the format Maloy used. Exams would have two phases: the individual phase for the first 24 hours and the group phase for 2 days after that. During the group phase, we're free to work with people Maloy assigned into our group and can change as many answers as we want (but we have to give written responses as to why we're changing them). Because of this, the exams were really easy to get high A's on. Overall, this class is pretty chill in the online format and has mild problems with busywork (Launchpad)."

Like this guy seriously empathizes with his students and understands.As for the class itself, I am an engineering student and was told by other engineering students that this class was going to be easy and basically a GPA boost, and they were right. If you had good teachers in high school for AP Bio, this class is basically just a review of everything you did there, and it's a breeze. The only homework is launchpad assignments, which everyone complains about, but I really did not think they were that bad. We had launchpad due two times a week, Tuesday and Thursday, and each assignment literally only took me an hour. On rare occasions maybe like an hour and a half, but also sometimes less than an hour. (I also never took notes on the launchpad material, I know some people do). The tests are not too bad, either; sometimes he puts in some really tricky questions, but even after getting those wrong you can still get an A / high B. I did not study for any of the tests. Discussion sections and lecture are both mandatory. Both give you grades for participation, and they try to make everything super collaborative. So it's super easy to make friends."

They are basically a bunch of diagrams with T/F questions or multiple choice and Maloy makes them so tricky. Many people are failing, however some are doing very well. It all depends on how much time you are willing to put in. This is NOT an easy class and the TAs are not very helpful. The CLC hours are very helpful though.

The class is based on points so try to compile as many as you can to be ready for the midterms and final. I personally did horrible on my midterms and final but because I went to class, did the hw and went to the labs I passed the class. What I'm saying is that if you fail one midterm you still have many more other things to fall back on. It'll be okay.

the material itself isn't very difficult in my opinion, but it is very content heavy, especially in the launchpad assignments. dr. maloy's lectures are very engaging and you get participation points for answering questions every lecture, which ends up being a lot of free points, since it's not based on accuracy. as for studying for the tests, i suggest ditching the heavy launchpad textbooks completely and just go over the slides he posts, the ta and la worksheets, and also, i cannot stress this enough, go to office hours."

Your exam grades are an average of your individual attempt and when you take the exam again after discussing your answers with your group, which really helps your grade. My advice would be to go to office hours because his office hours are very helpful, DEFINITELY go to review sessions before the exams because the same questions show up on exams, and study the clicker questions (!) and PEQs because similar ones show up on the exams.

J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Spring 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 23, 2021",A,"Professor Maloy is a great professor and explains things thoroughly. I think the way that the class is formatted, which I think is the general format of the LS7A classes regardless of the teacher, gave a lot of room for you to have bad grades on a few assignments while still maintaining an overall good grade. The exams have a group portion which really helped raise my test grades, and you're allowed to miss a week's worth of content in every category so that makes up for any days where you had a bad score on a certain assignment category. After my first test, I realized that it was much more analytical and required more critical thinking than I thought. It was definitely doable, but a bit challenging because I focused more on memorizing concepts like I did in previous biology classes. However, for these tests, you need to practice using critical thinking by studying the clicker questions, LA worksheets, making up your own questions about how certain processes would be affected if something was changed etc., in order to actually practice going through the thought process behind answering a question, not just skimming over facts. Also, don't just read the questions and their corresponding answers when you're studying and actually try to figure out the answer on your own so that it won't be as difficult to answer questions on the exams. The LA workshops were also extremely helpful because the problems are more challenging and it was helpful working with other classmates together in breakout rooms to solve problems together. Launchpad was an easy way to get points, but the readings could be somewhat tedious. Make sure you don't study or read Launchpad readings to heavily, since all you need to know is in the lectures and the tests focus more on analysis than memorizing facts. Discussion worksheets were pretty easy since the TA's give you the answers at the end even though it's based on accuracy."

That being said, the entire LS7 Series is all standardized to the point where It does not matter what professor you get when it comes to the content, grading, and exams. The LS 7 Series is structured horribly in my opinion, the upside down classroom is very frustrating to deal with and is not ideal. The exams are also unnecessarily tricky when it comes to wording and objective. The series basically tests you on how well you can take an exam rather than how well you know the content of the exam.

My only method of studying was to use the textbook (my bad haha), and I failed every exam. I do believe it would have been much more beneficial to have attended more of Maloy's office hours, as he workshopped difficult problems that would be covered on exams, dove deeper into abstract concepts discussed in class, and clarified any questions about the material.

The group phase is where you are assigned a group and you discuss any answers that are confusing to you and/or are different from your peers'. This phase allows you to use your notes and resources and lets you change your answers as long as you provide some reasoning. The group phase helps a lot in boosting your exam grades because Dr. Maloy takes the average of the two phases as your grade for the exam. He's very funny, engaging, and kindhearted.

Class itself isn't bad either- definitely go to lecture, as there's required clickers and he clears up a lot of the weird launchpad stuff. Personally, while I found launchpad to be helpful for getting content overview, the clickers were by far the most useful things to review for exams. Grading is pretty fair- Launchpad PEQS are really cursed but I did super mediocre/bad on all of them and still got that A. Plenty of places to earn points. Exams have two portions, the individual portion and then the group phase. They're all application based questions, which I personally liked but I know a lot of my group didn't. But with the group phase you have a chance to review your answers and resubmit so that can be a huge help if you aren't the best test-taker. Coordinating with your test group can be a pain though.

There was a lot of content to go over in the online textbook, Launchpad, but I learned a lot from it. He offers a good amount of extra credit which served me well! The midterms and final can be a little bit tricky when considering the specific wording. The class was also grouped into groups of 6 from discussion sections and because I took this course online, it was nice to talk and work with other students. Overall a good class, I learned a lot."
J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Jan. 17, 2021",A-,"Dr. Maloy is super nice and really accommodating! I switched into this class right before the week 2 add/drop deadline and he was really nice about helping me get caught up. I think he really put a lot of effort into trying to facilitate small groups and problem solving sessions to get us to interact with each other, which I really appreciated. 
That being said, I still didn't like this class. Launchpad is a nightmare and felt like a waste of time because it's so much harder to skim for important information on an online textbook where you actually have to click through the pages, and anything important was always surrounded by entire paragraphs of useless information. The content covered in this quarter was mostly a repeat of AP Bio but funnily enough I feel like I actively forgot things I learned in AP Bio over the course of this class. However, the stuff we covered this quarter also happened to be the stuff I've never liked even in AP Bio so that could've contributed to my lack of interest in this class's content. 
Honestly I don't think this class is that difficult to get an A in as long as you 1) join on time and 2) stay on top of things. I literally forgot to do the entire last week of PEQs because I didn't know they were closing early... don't be like me. Midterms + final were really nice because you have an individual phase and then a group phase, which was just repeating the entire individual phase except with your group and access to notes/internet/etc. Lots of extra credit offered too. 
I don't think he rounds grades up... I got a 92.8 and emailed him asking to round me up to a solid A and never got a response back (rip). You can ask for assignments to be regraded if it'll change your grade though, so I don't know if that would've made a difference for me. 
One last thing: there are quite a few 'growth mindset' activities that were unrelated to the course content. Basically free points and pretty easy to complete but really annoying to have to sit through, especially when it was like ""an external locus of control, which is bad, is when you attribute your difficulties to your circumstances"" during a pandemic... felt a little callous, but that might just be me."
J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Jan. 8, 2021",A,"The LS7 series is very standardized, so regardless of who you have as a professor, the objective difficulty of the exams will be basically the same since they pull from a standardized test bank across all of the 7A/B/C professors. On top of that, the class is a flipped classroom format meaning that you are expected to do the Launchpad readings (long and annoying busywork tbh) and learn the material on your own ahead of class. In class, Maloy will explain the information in a deeper context and will give you practice questions called clicker questions (these are graded on live completion and you need to answer 75% of the questions each day for full participation credit). Differences in exams between professors will typically be in a structural change rather than a question change (for example, Maloy may give you a two-part midterm where one is individual and one is group and take the average of the two parts for your overall midterm score while another professor may only give an individual portion but will allow for the exam to be open note).
That being said, while the class is standardized, if you are strong in biology when you enter this class, you most likely will observe very little difference in the difficulty of the class between professors. The quality of the professors and how well they explain concepts will only be of considerable concern to you if you find yourself confused or struggling in the class (at which point you'd better hope your professor can properly explain things. Fortunately, Maloy can explain very well). I did not have to attend his office hours or get extra help, so your mileage may vary compared to my review. 
Maloy is a sweet professor who really encourages collaboration (so much so that he will assign you a peer group for the quarter to work with after class). You can tell that he really cares about teaching and that he wants to give you a fair and proper lesson every class. He never skimps on the quality of his lectures and will take any questions you have. You will enjoy having him as a professor. As a consequence however, since Maloy teaches at a slower pace in order to fairly accommodate everyone's learning speeds, the class may feel excessively slow to some (that's me. I'm some). Regardless, if you pay attention in class, you will learn the material more than well enough to do well on the exams. If you do not pay attention, you better be confident in yourself."

The midterms and finals were a bit difficult (they are comparable to AP bio MC exam questions) but they had a group section that you would basically have the chance to discuss the midterm with a group of your classmates and change your answers if you wanted to.

IMPORTANT: The content in lecture slides is far more important than LaunchPad material, so focus on that. It is far likelier that you will encounter a problem or a concept that was reviewed during lecture slides rather than a trivial fact or question in the LaunchPad textbook.

The exams in this class are mostly application MC questions. The best way to study for this is by a) going to the CLC sessions (these are SO helpful and very similar to exam questions), b) reviewing clicker questions, c) attending Maloy's exam review sessions, and d) reviewing learning objectives if you have time.

Dr. Maloy and Dr. Braybrook taught the course together. Dr. Maloy gave the first half of the lectures while Dr. B would respond to questions in the chat, and vice versa during the second half. Both are wonderful, kind, and bright, professors and people in general. There are A LOT of moving parts in this class. As you've probably already heard or read, Launchpad is the worst, but it doesn't seem like much can be done about it, so you just have to power through it. I started skimming through Launchpad towards the end of the course and found that lectures, office hours, discussion sections, and CLC Problem-Solving Sessions were way more worth your time. Lectures are mandatory because iClicker Reef is utilized. There are 2 midterms and a final, both of which had an individual phase and a group phase. The exams were almost purely application-based rather than memorization, so working through clicker questions, CLC worksheets, discussion worksheets, PEQs, and creating similar practice problems from those help greatly. Practice is KEY. Form virtual study groups if you can! Collaborating with classmates was really helpful in understanding concepts. There is some leeway for points if you miss a couple of assignments (but trust me, do your best to keep up and write down due dates somewhere), and there are also opportunities for extra credit (which you should take!). I personally did not enjoy this class, but it was manageable and I got through it.

I do agree it's pretty time-consuming, but it did help my understanding of the material. There's room for mistakes in the grading, which I really appreciate, so you can miss a few points on practice exam questions, discussion worksheets, clicker questions, etc. and still get a great grade in the class. Definitely go to office hours as much as possible, as Prof. Maloy cleared up much confusion on harder topics as well. These professors really want you to succeed, and they do so via their office hours, problem-solving sessions, and PEQs. I really recommend this class."

J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 30, 2020",A,"As someone who doesn't have too strong of a background in biology, I'm glad I took this course with Dr. Maloy. He is very qualified and always explains important concepts thoroughly and clearly. His slides are well organized and he provides the necessary study tools to succeed on exams (iclicker questions, slides, exam review sessions, office hours, etc.). The exams and grading of the course were fair in my opinion. 
Course Breakdown: 
-Midterm 1- 90 points (2 stages: Closed book individual stage and then open book group phase with 3 randomly assigned peers. Your score is the average of your individual phase and group phase.)-Midterm 2- 120 points (2 stages)-Final Exam- 200 points (2 stages)-Reflection assignments- 10 points (easy free points)-Discussion section participation- 72 points (Worksheet with your TA and discussion group. Based on accuracy as well as participation) -Lecture participation- 68 points (up to 4 points each lecture, can get full credit for clicking into 75% of the questions that day)-Launchpad assignments- 45 points (Busy work in my opinion, didn't help me for exams)-Weekly pre-class review questions- 45 points (still busy work from launchpad)- Weekly practice exam questions- 45 points (graded on accuracy)- Total: 695 points without EC
The exams were manageable because of the two stage system. Additionally, as long as you understand concepts and diagrams, you should be able to answer the questions without memorizing anything because he provides the relevant diagrams on the exams. I used lecture slides and iclicker questions to study and went to the exam review sessions and got A's on all the exams. (Launchpad was too time consuming and didn't help me.) The launchpad assignments, lecture participation, and discussion participation all have a little leeway (ex. you can miss one lecture and still get full credit in lecture participation). This quarter, there were probably about 10 points of extra credit offered, but since there were a total of 695 points, the EC made a minimal difference in the end. The only new thing this quarter was learning pods, where you're grouped with five peers from your discussion section. We met twice a week for about 15 minutes after each lecture to work on some ungraded problems he assigned us. Learning pods didn't really help me for exams, but it was nice to meet people at least. 
Overall: Highly recommend this professor for this course."

Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 28, 2020",A,"This class was definitely a challenging start, especially being online, but overall was a very good experience. The launchpad sometimes was a little bit obnoxious but what I actually found most helpful is just reading through and not taking notes. Before the first midterm I spent hours going through launchpad and taking notes but by the time the final had come around I had started just reading through launchpad and taking notes during lecture which I recommend. The exams are all about application so while it is important to know the information, focusing on the LA worksheets and clicker questions is the most helpful. All exams were averaged between an individual and a group score which was a godsend as well as the I believe 10 possible extra credit points.I did not find office hours helpful because the zoom would have 50 people in it so most of the time my questions wouldn't be answered, but it was helpful to hear the answers of other people's questions. Overall I LOVED Maloy and Braybrook and would highly recommend this class with these professors."

Maloy is great and tried his best to help everyone as much as he could. Launchpad is worthless, don't spend too much time on it. If you finish all your assignments and study for the midterms and final you should do well, and Maloy is a great professor. I definitely recommend."
J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 25, 2020",A,"I think Maloy does a pretty good job explaining topics and content. He also provided a ton of resources and opportunities to get help in the class, and he is easily approachable. I didn't like the flipped classroom set-up too much because personally I didn't have enough motivation to learn all the material thoroughly before the lecture and the LaunchPad was a decent amount of work, but his lectures are engaging and very helpful in learning the material. He held review sessions before the midterms, and gave useful assignments too. He cares about his students, and was very understanding/accommodating of the various issues that came up during these past few months."

He is an amazing lecturer who makes the more difficult concepts covered quite simple. One thing I recommend is to focus more on his lectures than the Launchpad, as the tests in the class are the concepts covered on the lectures. The Launchpad seems kind of excessive with the information it contains. Other than that, I really appreciate the individual/group testing and the various LA learning sessions that were provided. Just make sure to understand the concepts in lectures through clicker questions and you'll do fine!"
J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 24, 2020",A,"Professor Maloy is an excellent lecturer; concepts are always clearly explained and applied(in fun and interesting ways too!). I highly recommend getting questions answered directly in class either by raising your hand or using the chat function. Prior to an exam, it is really helpful to review Launchpad PEQs, Clicker Q's, and to attend the Problem Solving Sessions that the professor administers. I also found doing the LA worksheets to be very useful as well as reviewing learning objectives that were on the weekly slides. Launchpad for me was beneficial in learning the details of the course topics, and lectures would solidify the bigger picture and how to apply those concepts. Discussion Sections for this class were also really great for elevating understanding. Overall, just stay on top of your work and don't miss out on participation points and getting to solidify your understanding during group phases of exams(and you'll enjoy it)!"
J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 23, 2020",A,"Alright, it's LS7A so it's gonna be hard, but Maloy definitely made it a lot more reasonable especially in online learning. Maloy did a lot of stuff that the other profs did not which is why I would definitely try to take him. He offered review sessions before every midterm and the final that were recorded so you did not even have to go. He also gave us learning pods which were small groups that we would we do extra problems with. My TA was really great but I heard mixed reviews about some of the others. My TA was really helpful because Maloy's OH usually had like 100 people in them so I could actually get my questions answered with the TA. The only thing that really bothered me was the disc section points. The syllabus really implied that the worksheets we did in disc would be graded by participation but that was not the case. One of the TAs wrote on campus wire that they told us this early on in the quarter, but my TA never did this and none of my other classmates who weren't in my section were aware of this either. So just make sure that you have everything right on your disc worksheets because those are some easy points you can lose. Otherwise, Maloy is a joy and was super understanding in covid. Midterm 2 is definitely the trickest for whatever reason. My advice for the exams is to do the launchpads but once you relatively understand them never look at them again the test will be nothing like it. For practice, retake PEQs go to review sessions and do the clicker questions. When you're taking the test make sure you don't make any silly mistakes. The midterms are 2 hrs for 60 questions which can be a time crunch. The final was 3 hrs for 80 questions which was really hard to sit through. Retaking the exams with a group was really helpful though and this score made up 50% of that exam's final score. This was a pretty good class all and all!"
J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 23, 2020",A,"THIS MAN IS A KING. 100% RECOMMEND. Professor Maloy and Professor Braybrook (he co-taught with her this quarter) were honestly the perfect professors for my first quarter and I will very much miss them while taking 7B. Both professors were very engaging and knowledgable about the subject; I think their lectures were the only ones that I didn't mind going to because they taught very well and answered every question thoroughly. Maloy and Braybrook's chemistry is so amazing, so if you're lucky enough to get a class with them, you are set. TAKEAWAYS (this was written while classes were online due to COVID, so anything may change when going back to in-person classes):LAUNCHPAD READING: Ok this is the only downside of the class. Every week you have to do about 2-4 hours worth of reading/video lectures/video animations/review questions (if you are taking notes at least). I personally took notes, but this could be a waste of time. The minimum you have to do is skim the reading, skip the video lectures and animations, and pray that some angel posted the review question answers on Quizlet. Most of the reading is not worth studying in depth but can provide a good overview of what is going to happen in the lectures for the week.LAUNCHPAD EXAM QUESTIONS: These were pretty helpful, so I recommend taking these more seriously than the assigned readings. The midterms and final were kinda framed like these questions. What's kinda scary is that some questions on the midterms and final had questions that had content that were on these questions but not in the lectures, so its useful to use these to study.LECTURES/CLICKER QUESTIONS: These are probably the most important resources you get in the class. Due to COVID, lectures were on Zoom, recorded, and posted on CCLE (the slides were as well). You gotta attend lectures so you can do clickers, but considering these are Maloy and Braybrook lectures, you shouldn't dread attending. To study for the midterms and final, you HAVE to go over the lecture slides (all the content you need to know are on these slides) and clicker questions (very similar to questions on the tests). The clicker questions emphasize what you need to know for the midterms and final.DISCUSSION: I had a great TA (shoutout to Maddie) as did everyone else. What matters, however, are the worksheets you have to submit. I actually forgot these weren't graded on completion so I got a few 50% on some of them (oops). But these can be very usefully when studying for the exams.MIDTERMS/FINAL: I heard a lot of people struggled with these tests, but if you study smart you can do very well. What I did: reviewed Launchpad Exam Questions (NOT THE READINGS), reviewed lecture slides and clicker questions, reviewed discussion worksheets, and attend the problem solving sessions that Maloy and Braybrook organized. The saving grace: individual and group phases. I wish every STEM class adopted this method of test taking. There are two phases: an individual phase (where it is ""closed-book"" and you take the test on your own) and a group phase (you have two days to discuss the test with a designated group of students and you are allowed to change your answers on the test); each phase is worth 50% of your overall exam grade. This relieved a lot of stress and actually helps you learn the topics through collaboration and discussion. Piece of advice: please don't memorize every detail about cellular processes (they will provide diagrams of the genetic code, cellular respiration, etc.); the exams are very application based.Overall, this class was pretty great and the professors were amazing. I would honestly take this again. So far the LS7 series hasn't ruined my love for bio. Lastly, please read the syllabus because everything is on there (it was kinda annoying when someone asked a question that could be answered by the syllabus)."

Honestly the professors are both gems, but the course is difficult. You have weekly Launchpad readings that take a long time, but they post reading guides on CCLE. If you just take notes on what is on the reading guides and skim through the rest of the Launchpad readings, you should be fine. Since it's a flipped classroom, you are expected the learn the material before class and come to the lectures ready to apply the concepts you learned. You can miss a few clicker questions, but they do count for participation and are extremely helpful for the midterm and final. For all the midterms and finals, we had an individual and a group portion, and our final score was the average between the two scores. Maloy and Braybrook hosted problem solving sessions before the midterm and final, where they gave us practice problems and we could work on them individually or in a breakout room. Maloy and Braybrook are great lecturers and explain concepts very clearly. They are very approachable and patient, and they will answer any questions you have at the end of lecture or during office hours. If you need to take this class, take it with either of them"

His lectures were reasonably engaging, especially since the clicker questions (graded for participation, not correctness) forced you to pay attention. The online textbook and activities were a bit tedious, but they are very easy. You read through the textbook, do some brief quizzes (many of which have multiple attempts available) and you get participation points. It tracks your progress, and a lot of people lost points here for no reason.
Aside from the easy participation and clicker points, discussion worksheets were fairly simple and our TA went over everything in depth at the end of each session. 
Exams were designed for our success. You completed the exam individually and then worked as a group to compare answers. If the group decided to change an answer, you simply filled out an answer change reasoning form to show that you actually understood the concept and learned. Then you'd be graded on your corrected collaborative exam (as well as your participation with the group.) 
Even if this class were in person and more difficult, I'd take it again because Professor Maloy is a great instructor who genuinely cares about his students."

They really stress the idea of giving you problems that demonstrate you really know the material and can make conclusions or do analysis rather than just regurgitate the textbook. Highly recommend going to problem solving sessions (super helpful) and putting effort into studying clicker questions, discussion worksheets and launchpad questions to get a sense of what kinds of things they ask for.
Launchpad is really tedious but very doable if you do a little each day. The online textbook has a lot of details that don't show up on exams so focus more on what's covered in video and class lectures.

As for every LS class, you have to purchase LaunchPad, the online textbook. If you buy it online, it gives you the option to buy it for one year. LaunchPad is pretty easy points, and although it is a lot, you should only pay attention to the learning objectives. We had an individual portion and then a group portion for the exams, which was extremely helpful. You have to answer why you changed your answer if you choose to do so during the group portion. Maloy himself is a wonderful professor. He has so much passion for this subject, which makes it way easier to stay engaged during lecture.

Maloy is all about studies on learning so he uses a ""reverse classroom"" way to teach. You have to click through assigned readings on Launchpad (which by the end of the quarter I was not even reading because it was so long) before nearly every lecture for points. Exams I thought were pretty fair and mostly based off of the clicker questions for points during lectures and from the lecture slides. I'm not sure if it was because my class was online or not but we were allowed to work with assigned groups of 3-4 people and use our notes on going over the test -- probably why my average on the final and midterm were mid to low A's. Also Maloy is very accommodating to students (even gave us 100% on our final when BLM protests were picking up and many students were concerned about testing in these circumstances)."

In addition, if you ever wanted to meet with him privately he gave you opportunities to do so. 
The tests are a pain in this class. However, if you pay attention during discussion section, study the clicker questions and the half sheets, you should get by pretty well. Apparently the CLC sessions the LAs hold are pretty helpful too, but I've just never been.

He is so clear and helpful during lectures and gives great examples/demonstrations. I highly recommend going to his exam review sessions because he basically formats them as a mini quiz session where he gives out questions off the top of his head and has us solve them for good practice. The workload of LS7A is honestly pretty light if you know what you need to work on the most to do well in class. Launchpad sucks and was honestly a waste of time when he'd go over all the stuff from it in lecture and it would be so much clearer. He always tells students to form study groups and to come up with your own exam questions and it really is the best way to study for the exams. I took AP Bio in high school and thought that just reviewing slides and clicker questions and memorizing them off the top of my head would let me do well on exams but it did not at all. The class is really about applying the concepts from lectures into a problem, so if you can create your own exam questions or modify the clicker questions to make new ones and then solve them, you're golden."

While I did enjoy this class, I do have to acknowledge that LS 7A as a class has a lot of issues. To begin with, Launchpad is a horrible resource. While the idea of a flipped classroom is great, Launchpad is just not the resource for it. It gives you so much unnecessary information and is a waste of time. Secondly, I had half the class with Dr. Lin who I learnt nothing from. Thirdly, the exams for this class is quite tough and it can be difficult to know how to prepare for. Of course, you can succeed if you put a good amount of effort and work smart.
Overall, despite certain issues I highly recommend taking LS 7A with Maloy. You can succeed in this class if you focus on the lecture slides, clicker questions and go for office hours and review sessions. 
Also shout out to my TA Jensen. This guy was the real MVP of the class. He helped us so much and was honestly even better than Maloy. He is the only reason I survived the Lin period."

His lectures are engaging, informative, and helpful to review when preparing for his midterms and final. Moreover, he provides a lot of assistance during his office hours. For Maloy's exams, you don't need to memorize anything, just be able to apply the knowledge you've learned in class; you'll be asked many critical thinking type questions. Be prepared, as the LS 7 series courses are inverted classes with your grade based on a point system. Inverted means that you'll learn most of your material on your own through LaunchPad (which make up a significant amount of the points in the class), only coming to class to reinforce what you've read/learned. The points refer to how many points each part of the course is worth out of a total. Make sure to snag the easy points like LaunchPad and discussion participation. Be sure to manage your time and ask Maloy questions throughout the quarter."

I found him to be a clear, concise lecturer and I really appreciated the many review sessions he held before midterms and finals. I would really, really advise people taking his class to take advantage of all the office hours and CLC sessions, both of which are super useful (way more useful than Launchpad) in understanding the material and preparing for the exams. Dr. Maloy offers a lot of these, so if I could go back and do this class all over again, I would probably go to more office hours!
However, like many other students, I found Launchpad and the whole idea of the flipped classroom to be pretty annoying, and oftentimes the material in Launchpad doesn't really correlate with what's being taught in lectures. Launchpad has a lot of extra information you don't really need, and although I took notes on Launchpad at first, it's not super helpful. I would recommend just skimming through Launchpad and only taking a few notes on the most important concepts or on the quizzes. 
If you're taking this class with another professors other than Dr. Maloy, make sure to check out the other professor's reviews as well! I took the class with Dr. Lin and Dr. Maloy teaching together, and although I love Dr. Lin as a person, his teaching wasn't the most clear and I had to basically learn all of the second midterm's material on my own.
tl;dr Launchpad isn't important, take advantage of office hours/extra credit, and make sure to check out the second professor's reviews!"

It did not in any shape or form test knowledge rather it was more about how well you take tests and critical thinking skills. This was most probably why the class was difficult as the tests are unpredictable and every time you come out of the exam you have no idea how well you did. My words of advice is to just try your best and hope things turn out your way.

They gave a million resources (LAs, TAs, CLC, CampusWire forum, preclass worksheets (optional), clicker questions, practice exam and review questions, and practice tests on Launchpad). They know that the style of testing is new (it's like similar to the ACT science portions based on diagrams, charts, etc.). The first midterm is weighted way less than the second midterm, knowing that it will be the first test in this style that many students will be taking. There was extra credit and a curve. Prof. Maloy pushed me to work hard and I appreciate it. I think it will push me to work just as hard in my other classes, such as in the rest of the LS7 series!!"

I thought the material was simple enough but it was difficult to get used to the exam questions (we have 2 midterms and a final). They are application based and kind of weird. However, I put in a lot (a LOT) of time into this class and ended up doing well. Flipped classroom and launchpad suck, go to office hours and CLC sessions to learn the material. If you don’t have to take this class, I’d recommend against it just because it took way more time and effort than I thought it would."

Taking this class as an incoming freshman, I was immediately made aware of the academic rigor of UCLA. This class is extremely fast-paced and you have to remember so much material it is insane. Maloy definitely cared about his students and hosted plenty of office hours, especially before midterms and the final. He was very engaging, and whenever he taught the class, I felt like I learned so much. He made 7A kind of bearable. IIf you want to survive this class, make sure to always stay on top of it, and attend office hours!!! The exams are monsters so make sure you really study your ass off."
J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 20, 2019",B,"Like everyone has said, Launchpad sucks! It's $105+ for the access code and a complete waste of money. However, you must purchase it because almost 1/3 of the class points come from Launchpad activities. It is extremely time consuming and expect to spend 3+ hours a night on homework. The two midterms and final aren't even based off Launchpad, so don't expect your hard work to pay off. They are application questions that are worded weirdly and are extremely hard to answer. Attendance to both lecture and discussions are mandatory. Lectures are solely clicker questions (you do need a clicker for the class that's about $50) and you don't learn any material, just review what you briefly learned through Launchpad. Overall, Maloy was a great professor. He was super enthusiastic during lectures and had a ton of office hours to assist students. He is genuinely one of the best professors you'll have at UCLA and you can tell he's passionate about teaching but is constrained by the format of the LS7 series. If you don't have to take this course for your major, DON'T, it definitely isn't an easy GE. But if you do have to, try to take it with Maloy."

If you are not understanding the material, I HIGHLY recommend going to office hours to ASAP because the class is pretty fast paced and it is easy to fall behind. Though this class was a lot of work, Maloy made it really engaging and interesting. But if it's not required for you, honestly take another easy GE."

I am really into the course material and the flipped classroom setting allow me to think of more problems and do more online research about the details. Maloy also tells about many interesting researches and applications. 
We are seated according to discussion sections making it easy to form stronger bond, and I am very glad to meet so many great people!! 
The exams are kinda hard compare to homework practice questions. I think the main trick is to go to all of the 4 office hours before the exam weeks. Even you don't have questions, Maloy always comes up with very 'interpretive' practices that allow you to connect knowledges across chapters.
For TA, I am very fortunate and super grateful to have Liz. She makes the sections very interesting and clear and knows the concepts very well.
One last note: don't put in way too much time in the class, or your other courses may not have good grades. Ask questions instead of stuck on them all the day."

Launchpad is rather tedious, but it is helpful for gaining some background knowledge on the subject. The exams were challenging in the sense that they test more on concept application than knowledge - you have to be able to apply the concepts more than memorizing them."

The class itself sucks though, LaunchPad is a pain and lectures weren't really that useful. Attendance is mandatory because of clickers, that's pretty much the only reason I went. You basically have to study everything by yourself. The tests are really similar to the review and practice exam questions on LaunchPad, as well as the clicker questions in class, so make sure you really know them. It's more application of concepts rather than memorization, so the practice exam and clicker questions really prepare you for that. Discussions were okay, you just go in and do a worksheet."

The extra credit given in this class sucks completely so don't bank on it saving your grade. 
The tests/exams are difficult and you aren't the only one struggling. It's all about improving. If I could do it again, I would do everything I can to take advantage of reviewing the midterm questions. The TAs allow you to look over your tests and the questions you got wrong for a week. 
I had a hard time wrapping my head around the test questions because the test questions didn't seem to correlate with what we were reading in launchpad. They correlate perfectly with Lecture and the other supplemental shit done outside of lecture. I know people who aced the class and got a C or D on the first midterm."
J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Spring 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 26, 2019",B,"Professor Maloy really cares about his students and that is evident by how he helps students during lecture. However, LS 7A is a poorly organized class and requires a lot of teaching it yourself. Lectures are usually just clicker questions, which unfortunately don't really help your learning. However, I thought Maloy was a great person and teacher. I would take another class with him that is organized in a better fashion."
J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Spring 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 26, 2019",A,"So usually LS 7A is taught with multiple professors utilizing the flipped classroom format, and Professor Maloy is one that certainly knows the in and outs of this teaching style. Lectures consist of him going over slides and some clicker questions (they count as part of your grade, but clicker questions are graded based on completing 75% of that lecture's clicker questions), and he encourages you to converse amongst yourselves. It's a good method that encourages both learning and socializing, so much so in that I found it relaxing and enjoyable to go to his lectures (he brings his dog in, so be on the lookout for that!).Outside of lecture, you will have both Launchpad and discussion. Launchpad can be annoying sometimes, but usually there is a quizlet (and if not coursehero usually has a free preview lol). I'm not saying this to encourage you to look off of them, but rather to note the fact that Professor Maloy himself said that Launchpad is more for getting the background knowledge, and studying the clicker questions and lecture content is so much more crucial for the exams. In discussion, you will have worksheets to do, which will count as part of your grade. You are encouraged to work in groups, and honestly, most people should get these points, either from doing the work or asking for help from the TAs (who seem more than willing to help you do well in this class).Like above, study the clicker questions and lecture content for the exams, it is by far the most crucial part. There are really a lot of application problems (e.g. looking at this biological system, what would happen if this part was inhibited?) and very few pure memorization problems. Make sure to utilize the diagrams on the exams, because those can definitely be helpful. Also, all exams (1 final, 2 midterms) are multiple choice (with both midterms being around 60 questions and the final 100 questions), and they provide the scantrons, so no need to worry about that part of the class.In terms of grading, everything is on a straight scale (unless the average is below a 75%), so you don't need to worry about competition or anything. There are a total of 726 points (76 clicker points, 80 discussion points, 90 midterm 1 points, 120 midterm 2 points, 200 final points, 150 total points possible from Launchpad, 10 weekly survey points), with the straight scale boundary being 93% and up for A, 90%-92.9% for A-, etc. Overall, as long as you are staying on top of your work, because Maloy lectures so well, you should be able to ace this class!"

But that could have been for the ""flipped classroom"" and the clicker questions/speed. The flipped classroom just does not work for a 400 person class, and while clicker questions could be helpful they would spend 10 minutes on one question and everyone would just end up talking. Or he would give us 30 seconds and then not go over it. While I really wanted to like Maloy, I found that I really just liked him as a person not as a professor. For the class in general, it is helpful to go over clicker questions and PE questions for the midterm and final."

That's something I wish I did more after taking the course. There's a lot of assignments in this course that you have to keep track of (reflection assignments, launchpad readings/quizzes/practice exam questions, etc.,) so make sure you're doing all of them on time. He also offered 2 extra credit opportunities my quarter so jump on that. CLC is also a good resource. Keep track of all the papers you get because they can help. Attendance in this class is important (tracked with iClicker); actually pay attention in class because he goes over a lot of important things. All in all, it's a good class.

Flipped classroom is doable and there are a lot of extra points to get, but you have to make sure you're managing your time wisely relative to other classes as well. Also make sure to take advantage of all the study opportunities and resources, like CLC hours and taking the practice exam questions seriously. With Maloy, in-lecture discussion isn't as important because he explains everything clearly and thoroughly. His teaching style works very well with the exam format. Make sure to understand not only the correct answer but why the other options are incorrect—TA OHs are extremely helpful for this. He is engaging and very passionate about his work. I haven't been to any of his review sessions or OH, so I can't speak on that. 
Because this class is listed under multiple professors, avoid Campbell if you can. His lectures are extremely dry and definitely unbearable if you don't have anyone to talk to lol. He also wasn't as clear in explanations as Maloy."
J.P. Maloy,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Spring 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 15, 2019",A,"Maloy for 7A was one of the best teachers I have had at UCLA so far. With the new ""flipped classroom"" approach that the LS7 series uses, it can be quite apparent which teachers are well-versed in such a classroom setting and which ones are totally inept. Maloy clearly knew how to teach in this manner. His lectures are clear and concise, and his clicker questions are very useful for learning the material and putting the concepts to use. If you don't understand something the first time around, he is also great at explaining things in office hours, where he'll clarify concepts and make some practice problems. Structure of the class is fairly simple; you have two midterms (the 2nd one is 30 points more than the 1st so you have a little more leeway if you mess up) and a final, and the rest of the points is obtained through attending discussion sections and completing work on Launchpad. All of that is free points and in 7A actually accounts for like 40% of your grade, so do them. This class is pretty smooth sailing if you pay attention in lecture and really put an emphasis on the clicker questions (what concepts they ask about, how they word the questions, etc.) when you study. Maloy certainly made this class as manageable as possible. If you have the choice, take 7A with him, hands down."

They're incredibly helpful.The material itself is easy: more concept application than memorization. Use clicker questions to study.

He's an energetic professor and is very passionate about teaching. The use of clicker questions and review quizzes on LaunchPad (the online textbook) really helped me gage how well I understood the course. There are a lot of resources for those who are struggling: I'd highly recommend going to the Collaborative Learning Center's Problem Solving/Q+A sessions to review each week's material and to professor/TA office hours. The lectures themselves are really engaging - full of colorful diagrams and opportunities to work with your neighbors - and Dr. Maloy was a terrific presenter. Dr. Maloy also used worksheets during the lectures to emphasize key points, which were especially handy when preparing for the exams.However, the LS series may seem daunting at first. LaunchPad can be somewhat deflationary, as the practice exams are very challenging. Each week, you are assigned reading on LaunchPad, followed by straightforward review quizzes, which you can attempt up to 3 times and pause if needed. However, the practice exams are a different story. They are timed and you only have one shot at them, making them very stressful. There are answers posted on Quizlet (everyone seems to be aware of this, even the Learning Assistants), but I'd caution against using those. The practice exams, while they are quite stress-inducing, are very helpful when studying for the exams. Additionally, each one counts for a mere 5 points out of 722, so they aren't especially weighty in final grades. These are a helpful tool to succeeding in the course.Dr. Maloy really emphasized student learning, which was great! He dedicated 10 easy course points to watching educational videos about the science of learning and filling out surveys about how we perceive our own ability to learn. In the face of my first quarter's near-constant stress, these reflection questions were a pleasant reminder that, even when faced with difficulty, I was capable of overcoming it. I was never able to go to Dr. Maloy's office hours because of an unfortunate schedule conflict, but I emailed him several times. He is very prompt with his replies and cares deeply about addressing student concerns.It's also great that there are a LOT of points in this course, which gives students quite a bit of room to struggle and learn without seriously jeopardizing their grades. Overall, it was a great experience despite some initial difficulties. I'd give this course a 5/5, although it was certainly challenging, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in life science and cells/molecules."

I couldn't find Maloy under LS 107 or LS 4 for some reason and I don't want to go through the trouble of adding him cause I'm lazy. Anyways, Maloy is not that bad of a professor. He is clear, has good practice problems, reflect his exams on his lecture and clicker questions, and provides a lot of extra credit (I think my grade was boosted by 4% thanks to it). My only problem with him is that he may be too easy. I'm not sure if it's because I took the class during summer, but it seemed very easygoing in his LS 107 class. I'm not sure how it was for others, but the class median for the first exam was a 68/90, avg. for second was 72%, and final probably something like a C to a C+. I would highly recommend Maloy if you want a do-able, yet a little challenging at times Genetics course. Hung Pham is the other Genetics professor whom I believe seems to be harder than Maloy, comparing Pham's exams to Maloy's. Clicker required, textbook not, 2 midterms + final (summer 2018), ~680 points, 1st exam 90pts, 2nd 120pts, final 200pts, video quizzes 50pts, participation during class & discussion 60pts, CCLE assignments (free points) 80pts, clicker ?'s 80pts, 27 pts extra credit you can easily earn."

Pham's lectures are fast-paced, but he goes over the clicker questions very well, which are all that really matter. I never attended his office hours but every time I asked him something after class, he was nothing but kind and extremely helpful. The LS Core Curriculum have a specific way of explaining problems and he does a great job of explaining what type of knowledge is expected of us. I would go to his lectures to figure out what type of material will be tested and go to your TA's office hours instead because they offer much more personal help."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 31, 2021",A,"Dr.Pham is SUCH A GOOD PROFESSOR. You will be teaching a lot of the material to yourself so make sure to make use of the preclass worksheets and reading guides. These will help you focus on the important material since launchpad has soooo much to take in. Pham is a fast lecturer, but if you ask him to slow down or go over something again, he is always more than happy to do it. He also encourages questions like no other! He clearly (and I'm talking crystal clear) cares about his students :') Cellular biology can be complicated, but he will make sure you know he is there as a welcoming resource."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 21, 2019",A,"The flipped classroom format of this class means it relies on self-learning a lot through assigned readings/quizzes on the online textbook. Each week there are videos, textbook pages, and mini-quizzes (2-6 questions), which make up a fair amount of points (the class is out of 702 points). Staying on top of these is a must - you fall behind and it's really tough to get back on your feet. They are also super easy points that might push you from an A- to an A at the end.
The tests are quite difficult but Pham teaches you well on how to think through problems -- the questions force you to make connections with what you already know, which is why you need to stay on top of readings. There are also CLC sessions (kinda like office hours but led by Learning Assistants) that are of utmost important if you want to do well in the class. They provide worksheets that are of similar difficulty to the tests and the LAs help you walk through the problems and make connections. A lot of people who didn't do well in this class didn't go to these. They are a MUST.
Pham himself is a great guy. He makes funny jokes once in awhile and cares a LOT about his students. His accent takes a bit to get used to, but it's entirely understandable. He could be a bit more helpful when explaining clicker questions in class, but he will always expand more after class or in his office hours."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Winter 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 29, 2021",A,"I found this class tough. Dr. Pham seems very nice. However, I don’t think it matters which teacher you have. I didn’t take AP Biology but I took Molecular Biology in high school. If I hadn’t learned most of the material before, I would have done horribly in this class. It is very fast paced and you basically teach yourself everything.
Launchpad and pre-class assignments are so annoying because they’re so long and they contain a lot of information you don’t need to know. Lecture is very confusing. I struggled with the flipped classroom format, especially because it takes so much time, which I don't have.
CLC sessions and discussion sections are very helpful. You learn stuff you need to know for the tests in these sessions that they will not tell you during lecture or on launchpad. Be patient with the LA’s. It may seem very annoying when they don’t give you a straight answer, but they aren’t allowed to give you a straight answer. This approach the LA’s take wastes a lot of time, but make sure you ask them what you don’t know. Having an understanding of processes is extremely important.
There’s no need to memorize anything in this class. The tests are difficult because they try to trick you. It felt like taking the SAT reading section all over again, which I hated. Read the questions on the tests very carefully as they rely on the wording to trick you. Everything is multiple choice. You don't really get to ask for points back in this class.
Overall, I did not like this class. Molecular biology is very interesting, but the excessive amount of busywork and trickery in this class made me very stressed and upset. However, I will try to not let my experience in this class interfere with my opinion on the subject of biology itself."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Winter 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 22, 2021",A,"***I took this class during the COVID-19 pandemic in an online format.-The short way to describe this class (and the entire LS series) is that if you took AP Biology and remember most of it, the class is pretty free. Otherwise, it's a lot of information to take in and learn in such a short amount of time, but certainly doable if you use your time and resources well. Dr. Pham is a great lecturer (and his accent really isn't a problem, anyone complaining about it is just using it as a scapegoat) who will not hesitate to answer any questions or clarifications. He responds to emails very quickly too, and is always very accommodating.-The online textbook and clicker service must be purchased, but they're used throughout the entire series, so the price isn't terrible if you consider you buy it once for the whole year (still annoying though). LaunchPad can be a pain to complete, but spreading them out over the course of a few days before lectures certainly helps. The practice quizzes and PEQs on the LaunchPad are also great study resources. People disagree on what the best way to study is, but in general, clicker questions and PEQs seem to be many people's favorites. There's also weekly review sessions, plentiful office hours, and the LaunchPad textbook.-Lectures are unfortunately mandatory, with attendance being taken via clicker questions. You can just click random things to get participation credit, but the questions are very similar to exam questions, so I would not recommend that. You can miss one set of homework and one lecture of attendance and still get 100% in the class.-The points in this class other than the exams are all free. Discussions are graded, but you get all the answers from your TA if you are confused. Homework questions have 2 tries, and the practice questions are 1 try, but they're not meant to trick you. There's also some reflection assignments every other week or so, they don't take very long and are more free points. Extra credit is occasionally given for completing surveys, though to be honest, it's very unlikely that the EC will affect your final grade unless you are literally like three points away from a grade cutoff.-Exams are reminiscent of AP Biology — there are very few calculation or recall type questions, most, if not all questions are applications of topics gone over in class. It's definitely not enough to just memorize things (like photosynthesis, operons, etc.); you really do have to actually understand processes. The tests are generally fair, just a bit tricky, though for the times where a question is unclear, if it really is unclear, Pham will adjust the answer key and give you the points anyway. Pham doesn't actually make the tests, all LS7 tests are the same across all professors, so when choosing between the professors, you're purely looking at lecture quality, and Pham is great in that sense. One final thing to note is that exams have an individual component at first, taken in a 3 hour period during a 10 hour window. Then, you're randomly (not really, they balance the groups based on individual performance so each group has one person from each quartile) assigned a group of 4 people where you're free to discuss and change answers, to get back 50% of the points on the exam. -All in all, if you're looking at this review to decide between LS7A lecturers, Pham is a great choice. If you're considering LS7A as a GE, I'm assuming you're not a STEM major. If that's the case, and you don't feel confident in your biology knowledge, I would stray away from this class."

The required ""textbook"" where you complete the homework assignments and weekly quizzes on is called Launchpad and is just sooo expensive but the subscription lasts for at least a year, so you only buy it once for the whole series essentially. In order to do well, you need to make sure not lose any points that are easy to get such as in Launchpad, discussion, or extra credit points. The tests take some getting used to and are difficult, but comparable to the type of questioning in AP Biology. Overall, would recommend Pham to everyone!"
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 11, 2020",A+,"Professor Pham is the goat. His accent is a little strong but its easy to get used to. He truly cares about his students and just an overall nice guy. 
For Launchpad I recommend taking handwritten notes on the material, it makes the class 10x easier although it may mean having to spend more time doing launchpad. 
The tests for this class are kinda tricky but if you know the material well they're very straightforward. The only reason bio is hard is because of the vocab (and taking notes on launchpad will drill that vocab into your head)."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 30, 2020",B,"Hello, so I'll give a review of the 7A class itself first, and then get to Dr. Pham. To let you all know, all LS 7A (and I believe the entire series) classes are given the same midterms and finals, so it really does not matter which professor you get for any LS 7 class. I was terrible at ap bio back in high school and I gotta say that the 7A class was kind of rough for me. First, the entire series requires you to buy a $100 online textbook (called Launchpad) that you take notes on, and there are quizzes and short ""exams"" you must take in order to get points, if you find yourself struggling on these questions --> go to quizlet my friend, the answers are there. Based on my experience of 7A, please do not rely on Launchpad content and their quizzes to study for the midterms and exams, you do not need to know every little detail, only focus on the overall concepts and learning objectives, it will save you time and paper from taking notes. I forgot to mention that the LS 7 series is instructed like a ""flipped classroom,"" where you learn & teach yourself the content before lecture, and during lecture your professors will simply review the content with you. You will basically get tested on the content from lecture. This includes info from lecture slides, the small handouts you are given during lecture, and sometimes worksheets from discussion. To do well on the exams, focus on the lecture handout and go through the clicker questions one-by-one, and understand how to get the answer from the information given to you. If you don't know how to get the answer for a clicker question, go through the bruincasted lecture, find the specific question on the video, and see how the professor explains the answer. (this is how I studied for midterm 2 & the final and I was able to score 10% higher every exam using this method that a friend told me, & I completely failed midterm 1)For 7A, you must go to lecture because you need to answer clicker questions for points, you get points for simply pressing an answer, you don't get deducted anything by getting a question wrong. Now going on to Dr. Pham, this professor is a G. He made this class bearable for people new to bio (like me). He always has an answer to everything and he is VERY clear on explanations and concepts. I think students like him because he is willing to slow down the pace of the lecture and go through clicker questions step-by-step if students cannot understand what is being taught. He is even more helpful during his office hours because he will stand side-by-side with you, draw the handout, and explain every little thing on the handout with you. Even during lecture when he says something wrong or explains something weakly, he will admit to the students that he was at fault and then reexplain the entire question.I took 7A with Pham and Lazazzera, and I am sure Pham was liked more than Lazazzera because he was just better at explaining things than Lazazzera."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 24, 2020",A,Pham is great and he is what made this class bearable.

He is a little slow paced with lectures, which makes preparing for exams difficult. I learned a lot and made a good grade in the class, but I made Bs on all the exams (two midterms and a final). Pham knows what he is talking about and is extremely helpful during office hours."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Jan. 28, 2020",A,"Yes, Pham has an accent. It's obvious. BUT this in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM HINDERS STUDENT LEARNING. Pham is so nice to his students and stays hours and hours during his office hours so that everyone can ask questions, even the dumb questions. Although, I felt that this course was easier than AP Bio and was less about actually knowing/memorizing information than it was about interpreting graphs and data of provided scenarios. The material in the online Launchpad 'textbook' that costs over $100 isn't really even the main focus of the class, and it's only used to complete weekly practice review questions or practice exam questions (which, may or may not be on Quizlet for your convenience). What you really should study are the clicker question slides and learning objectives that are found in the lecture powerpoints. The exams (2 midterms and a final) are all multiple choice and it's common to get a B or above. As always, the more studying you put into it, the better result you'll receive. Anyway, Pham is very passionate about molecular bio and I definitely recommend him as a professor."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Jan. 21, 2020",B+,Lifescience 7a was harder than I thought it would be in weird ways. After the first test I felt extremely confident about my grade and understanding of the material however I was really surprised with the grade I got. Pham is a nice professor and he was willing to answer questions in office hours but there were very very limited resources for studying in that class and all he would recommend is studying clicker questions and handouts which again were extremely limited resources. Also there was an extremely heavy amount of homework online through launchpad which could take anywhere from 2-3 hours to finish on a given day. The midterms didn't feel hard but had tons of tricks and extremely questionable wording and the final exam was really challenging.
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 30, 2019",A,"You'll probably hear a lot of life science majors tell you that the 7 series isn't something you need to stress about, which is fair to some extent, but this is just about my personal experience. I didn't take AP Bio in high school and felt very behind and frustrated during the first few weeks of the course. I did poorly on the first midterm and was pretty discouraged, but I proceeded to work my butt off and I religiously attended professor and TA office hours, as well as the CLC problem-solving sessions (super helpful imo!). Don't be afraid to take advantage of all the resources you have, there's nothing wrong with struggling or needing help. That being said, I did pretty well on the second midterm, but the final was pretty hard. I didn't do great on the final (B-), but with all the launchpad, clicker, and extra credit points, I was able to get an A. Pham is a really sweet and genuine guy - very dadlike if you will - but I honestly didn't feel like he explained a lot of concepts and ideas well. I even went to Maloy office hours with friends because he tended to explain things better. It's all about what you make of it!"
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 26, 2019",B+,"The thing with the LS7 series is that the curriculum is standardized so it really doesn't matter who you have as a professor and all you do in class is clicker questions; however, I did notice that Maloy's class got to take both midterms a full week after Pham's classes did, despite being at the same pace as we were. Professor Pham was a little hard to understand at times during lecture but when you rewatch the lecture, you can figure out what he was saying. He also doesn't really offer much extra credit and is not the most lenient with Launchpad mishaps. There was an instance where the date some review questions were due was different from the date it said in the title and at least half the class missed those points but he didn't really do anything about it and told us to be more careful and to not miss anymore. Overall, he was an alright professor. I didn't really like his office hours and he didn't really do much to prepare us for the exams but that's the same with most of the LS7A professors this quarter. The discussions for this class were completely useless, all we did were random worksheets that really didn't help much and we finished them a lot in advance but couldn't leave early. The pre-class worksheets helped a lot more in preparation for the exams in comparison. My TA Sean didn't really know what he was doing a good most of the time and therefore, couldn't answer most of our questions without consulting the internet. He also would not let us take notes over what we missed on the exams like the other TAs allowed so I remembered none of what I missed and there was no point in going over my exams when I couldn't even take note of what I did wrong or need to focus on. Our LA was great, on the other hand. Onto the exams, they were definitely not easy. If you did not take AP Biology in high school, prepare to have a bit of a tough time with this class. The exam questions were worded very weirdly most of the time and you have to be really careful while reading the questions. You need to get comfortable with the ""if you change this, what happens to this?"" type of questions because that is definitely the majority of the exams. I got a C- on the first midterm (this was because my text anxiety was through the roof and I didn't read the questions properly, it was not nearly as hard as the other two) and a C on the second midterm (this one was definitely harder). I studied crazy hard for the final like I legitimately ignored the fact that I had two other finals to study for. I put in almost 100 hours of work into studying for it and got a C+ (almost a B-) on the final, which was above the average. I felt this was easier than the midterms but most people told me it was the same, if not harder, so I feel like the small changes I made in my studying for this class made a huge difference. honestly, i really hated this class so i'm just glad it's over. good luck for anyone taking this class in the future. 
Some advice for this class:- yes, you do have to buy the launchpad thing, you really can't get out of it- go over the learning objectives on the slides and really make sure you KNOW each one- understand every diagram/model given to you because i promise it will show up on your exam- when you're studying, go over the clicker questions and launchpad practice exam questions and understand why the correct answer is correct and why the wrong answers are wrong. don't bother with the launchpad review questions unless you have time. - videos help a lot with the concepts. you really want to have a good overview of each of the concepts and videos help a lot more than just reading your launchpad notes- the biggest changes i made in my studying for the midterms vs the final was that i did the pre-class worksheets and i took advantage of campuswire. campuswire was my savior and i honestly wish i had used it much much earlier. it helped so so much and you could find more practice material on it. - BIGGEST THING: do not lose points on launchpad, the discussion worksheets, or the other assignments we have to do. every point matters and you want to have some wiggle room for the exams. definitely do all the extra credit opportunities given, you think that two points won't make a difference but it can and it will."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 26, 2019",A,"Pham is a great professor --he's a sweet guy, very approachable, funny during lectures, and always encourages students. That being said, your success in the class is not very dependent on what professor you have, but rather how hard you study and understand the material. I never really attended office hours, but I did go to the LA workshops where they would give us little worksheets for more practice. (Shoutout to Shawn who was an amazing LA that offered very clear and concise explanations) Also reviewing and UNDERSTANDING the lecture slides, clicker questions, and practice exams helped me the most when preparing for exams."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 26, 2019",A+,I like him and I think he's both a good guy and a good professor. But I don't like the time consuming redundant stuffs in LS7A like those reflection videos and mindset control videos.
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 24, 2019",A,"The homework consists of readings followed by quizzes about the reading. If done in totality it's quite a bit of work, but if you skip the readings and do the quizzes it's hardly any. Doing the readings are helpful in understanding the information, but it's way too detailed with a ton of unnecessary information. Both midterms and the final were challenging because it's a big transition from high school. On top of memorizing the content you really need to understand the connections between concepts because the exams are all about analysis. His lectures aren't super useful in teaching but they do guide you in what to study. For the exams I recommend going over the concepts listed at the beginning of each lecture and watching youtube videos on the ones you don't understand. After going over lecture slides, go over all the clicker questions he posts."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 23, 2019",A+,"TBH, I feel like the way the LS7 classes are structured makes it so how you do in the class is more dependent on you than your professor. That being said, I sincerely enjoyed being in Pham's lecture this year. He's a nice and laidback teacher who seems to honestly enjoy teaching the subject. 
However, in my opinion, doing well in this class is more dependent on you and how you study. I have many friends who tried to memorize everything in preparation for the exams, and I'm telling you now THIS IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO STUDY. Instead, make your studying interactive. Create your own diagrams, questions, go through past exams with other students, make sure you really understand the concepts and how one concept connects to the other. I didn't spend any time making study guides of all the material we learned. Instead, I went through the learning/class objectives and answered those questions instead. 
Additionally, a large portion of the grade isn't dependent on exams. Attend lecture and discussion, finish your launchpad questions (some of them can be found on quizlet if you don't have the time to read through all the launchpad–which is lowkey useless in my opinion), and do the unrelated mindset surveys and questions that they make us do for points, SIMPLY BECAUSE THOSE ARE EASY POINTS THAT CAN MAKE UP FOR A QUESTION OR TWO LOST ON EXAMS. Don't get lazy and decide to not go to class or do a five minute mindset exercise, a good grade in this class is easily attainable."
Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 22, 2019",A+,"Professor Pham was so amazing!! I would highly recommend taking this class with him, because he cares so much about his students and genuinely wants everyone to succeed. I don't think I've ever heard someone ask a question to which he didn't respond ""Excellent question!"" He will never be condescending in any way or make you feel bad about being confused. He encourages people to ask questions about deeper understanding and if you have super basic questions because you don't have a strong bio background, he's more than happy to go over those with you as well. His lectures are all slides and iClicker questions, and you get to talk over clicker questions with the people around you before answering. Professor Pham does a great job explaining the clicker questions, and even though he talks fast sometimes, you can totally follow along as long as you stay engaged. The tests in this class were pretty challenging, but very doable as long as you studied hard and went to office hours to clarify any confusions. I gained so much from office hours and Professor Pham really helped a ton when we had questions. Going to all the office hours was a huge reason I did so well in this class, because instead of letting topics that confused me pile up, I got them clarified right away and Pham was always excited to answer questions. Also, Pham is so funny and he cracks jokes throughout lecture that keeps the environment super light. He's such a great professor; I looked forward to this class every week and I would take another class with him again- no question. If you've taken AP Bio in high school, then this class is mostly review for the first half, and the test questions have similar style to AP questions, where it's testing your ability to analyze experiments and hypothetical situations, rather than being memorization based. In fact, you don't need to memorize much for this class because all the diagrams are given on the test. And if you haven't taken AP Bio- don't sweat it! It teaches you all the intro stuff you need to know and as I said, Pham is happy to go over basic questions with anyone who asks. I have many friends who haven't taken gen bio in years and still did fine. Just be prepared to do a ton of work! Launchpad took me about 6-8 hours every weekend to finish. The good thing though is once you get Launchpad over with in the weekend, you have no hwk the rest of the week. Trust me, it's manageable and for me it was a very enjoyable class."

Hung Ding Pham,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 14, 2019",A,"It doesn't really matter who you have for LS7A, as the class is standardized (everyone takes the same exams, has the same assignments, same text, lectures, etc.). So if I were you I'd pick the time that's most convenient rather than going for a specific professor. The most important thing to remember about this class is that everything you do matters. Go to every discussion, don't miss a single assignment, and don't miss more than 2 lectures (you get two free absences) as there is no curve in the class and there are a lot of ""non-exam"" points, and you wanna optimize on all of these points since the exam can get quite tricky at times. I wouldn't say the material itself on the exams was difficult, there was minimal memorization and the concepts were pretty easy to understand, but the questions would get quite obscure and the wording was designed in a way to trick you at times. They key to doing well in the class is practice over absorbing material, if that makes sense. You have to get used to the way questions will be framed in exams. So focus on clicker questions and practice exam questions, and I'd also recommend going to the LA review sessions because they give you more questions to practice. Pham specifically was alright tho. He definitely has an accent but you get used to is pretty quickly so it's not that bad. He's also very nice and willing to help you if you ask him."

That being said, who you have has a professor doesn't really matter. The 7 series is completely standardized and you do most of the learning on your own anyway (flipped classroom). ____________________
There are a few important things to keep in mind if you want an A
These are the tactics that worked best for me: - Always do the launchpad and do your best to get every point possible -Don't skim the launchpad, actually do it and make sure you're reading the textbook-Don't focus on memorizing minor details and molecule names: Your primary focus should be the topics in the pre-class review sheet-If something is discussed in lecture or repeated multiple times MAKE SURE you know it- It's definitely going to be on the exam -If you're reviewing the clicker questions before an exam and you're stuck just review the lecture on bruincast- all of his lectures are recorded and posted there-Clarify topics you don't understand with your TA and don't be afraid to ask questions"

He's very patient and solves all doubts with genuine interest. His lecture slides are very helpful, and the online textbook and videos aid in concept clarity. His exams can have some trick questions that may be difficult to deal with, if you don't pay attention in class.The discussions are compulsory, and so are the quizzes and the online videos.

However, if you have taken AP/IB Biology, it will be a breeze. Almost all of the reviews have written about Professor Pires's ""flipped classroom"" which I did not mind too much, mainly because I was just reviewing much of what I had already learned in high school. But for those who have not taken biology, it will be as if you are teaching yourself an entire college course in just 10 weeks."
Debra B Pires,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 28, 2020",A,"(Took this class during COVID)
This class is pretty difficult. I think the LS 7 series in general is less about memorization but more about actually understanding concepts and applying them to new situations you've never seen before, which can be difficult for people who haven't done so in high school etc. It's pretty similar to AP bio in a sense where you apply your knowledge instead of just regurgitating it.
Even though this class was a lot of work, the LS 7A professors made accommodations for online learning which I think saved a lot of people's grades: group exams. For the 2 midterms and the final, there were two phases: an individual phase, where you would take the exam by yourself (open from 6 AM - 8 PM on a single day), and a group phase, where you would be assigned a group of 3 other people and have about two days to set up a time, talk about the exam, and individually submit a second copy of exam (all on CCLE). Your score for the midterms/final is an average of the individual and group phase exams. So yeah, you could straight up fail the individual portion but get carried in the group phase and come out with a relatively decent score, which I think really helped people out and changed perspectives on this course because I only heard negative things coming in (however there were students who *still* complained... despite having group exams). I'm not sure if the professors will continue doing this when things get back to normal, but I think it will really help the LS 7 series be more respected because there are many, many complaints about this series. As far as I know LS 7B and 7C have different kinds of accommodations in regards to helping recovering lost points on exams, but anything helps.
In regards to the professor, I took it when Pires was co-teaching with McEvoy. I found Pires to be a lot more knowledgeable and prepared to answer questions, but I do recognize that it was probably McEvoy's first time teaching 7A (if I'm not mistaken) and I wouldn't call her ""bad"" by any means. They were both pretty good and kind.
Be prepared to work hard in this class. It takes a lot of time to go through weekly launchpad readings but actually reading it and *not* just skimming it will actually help you learn the concepts, but I do get that sometimes launchpad content can give you more than you actually need to know. Clicker questions are probably the best practice tool you have in that class as they represent the questions on the midterms/final pretty well, so make sure to go through them while studying and be able to justify why an answer is correct or incorrect. A lot of people say they ""skipped through launchpad"" and ""barely paid attention in lecture"" and then wonder why they have a bad grade, I don't get it. If you're disciplined enough and put in the work you'll get the grade you deserve! You can do it! Good luck!"

A lot of the work you will need to do to succeed will be by yourself, taking notes online. This can be very time consuming, and I wish the professors would provide a bit more clarity on what is relevant to the course/tests versus what is not, because a lot of it sometimes seems pointless. It's important to go to class and not just do the clicker questions, but understand them. The professors, especially Deb, may seem hard-shelled at first, but I think they do genuinely care and want to help you learn. For me, the biggest help was going to discussion because those worksheets were most similar to the tests and my TA was super helpful and smart.

My brother who was taking AP Bio in high school at the same time that I took this class was learning the same things I was. 
Tests: 2 midterms and a final. You need to know your stuff inside and out for the tests, they're tough if you don't because the multiple choice answers can be very similar (all tests were multiple choice, but don't be fooled). The tests are less about memorization and more about testing your mastery of the concepts and applying them to new situations.
LaunchPad: Gotta buy the LaunchPad subscription, all your readings and quizzes are done through this :// -- it's like $70 and up depending on the plan you get (if you aren't taking 7A,B, and C all in one year then you should get the 2-year subscription) if you take diligent notes on LaunchPad, it can take up to 5/6 hours do finish, but if you don't, you could get through the work in maybe an hour or two depending on the workload that week
iClicker: If you're going to be taking a lot of science classes, it's a good idea to buy an iClicker ($40 unless you're able to buy it from someone for a cheaper price -- you can also rent one from Powell (see here --> https://www.teaching.ucla.edu/iclicker-rentals)) 
Lectures: participation is HUGE with Pires -- her lectures revolve almost entirely around clicker questions and collaboration in class and discussions
Structure: graded on a straight scale, three lectures per week and one discussion
Discussion: you do worksheets together with other peers and they're really helpful for tests
Extra resources: when I took the class, the TA hours were really helpful because one of the TAs made mini worksheets to compliment the course, which were really helpful. A lot of people came to these office hours because of the worksheets, and there were usually two or three TAs around to help. it would get crowded, but all the students helped one another too"

Dr. Pires is a great teacher though, and it is totally doable if you put in the work. Don't be discouraged by harsh reviews, a lot of people did not do the recommended optional work and so struggled. If you aren't super confident in bio just go to CLC sessions and review with the TAs at discussion and office hours."

Clickers are used and you get points for it so you'll want to attend. It's flipped style with loads of work due on an overpriced online textbook (no way around it). The 7 series is clearly a weeder for LS majors and premed students. The material is pretty much going to be the same no matter the professor, but in this case let me warn you. 
Pires and McEvoy suck. 
My friends took this class with a different professor and had a way better time (and did significantly better). Not only are they boring and unhelpful teachers, but they're also super unaccommodating. CAE students beware! I got a concussion during the quarter and they refused to excuse any attendance or adjust clicker points, they didn't follow university requested accommodations, and they ignored emails after the grades were released where I followed up about these things. Do yourself a favor and take this class with a nicer professor."

I would not recommend to take this series of you can learn on your own. The material is not too hard but I struggled to understand. It’s not a hard class to pass, I literally got an F for both midterms and the final and I passed the class with a B overall. Just make sure you don’t miss any launchpad material since it is worth a lot of points. Debra is great, I prefer her over Mcevoy. I took this class with both of them teaching.

I took LS7A Fall Quarter of my Freshman year, so I was fresh meat needing a little boost and extra guidance to acclimate to UCLA. Professor Pires was always condescending and would be-little you if you did not understand something or make snarky comments when you asked questions. I attended her office hours once and never came back after she cut my time short simply because I was super confused and my questions were ""too obvious."" What kind of help is that? I tried to do my best with the resources I had as a new-comer. Stay away from taking any courses with Pires. She is the absolute worst professor."
Debra B Pires,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Summer 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Aug. 18, 2020",A,"I took the 3-week intensive version of the LS7A, which I think is too rigorous so I'll stick to the 6-week or 10-week in the future. Dr. Pires is a decent lecturer, but tbh I don't think the professor matters much for this series since it's mostly self-study (and all the tests, labs, etc are about the same no matter who teaches). The Launchpad readings are often way too detailed and wordy for the actual midterms and final. The reading quizzes and practice exam questions don't help much either. You're much better off attending the CLC sessions (aka problem solving sessions), because those ACTUALLY drill in the concepts and teach material useful for the exams. For the exams I also just reviewed the slides and clicker questions, realizing that memorizing stuff from Launchpad was a waste of time. Also set yourself a reminder for when each Launchpad assignment is due--I literally missed an entire practice exam question set, an entire reading set, and an entire reading quiz set (yep one of each) because I'm forgetful and mixed up due dates. Luckily the LS7 series gives you some leeway and allows you to miss up to 5 points (equivalent to one ""set"") and still receive full credit (you get this for the readings, the reading quizzes, and the PEQ's)."
Debra B Pires,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Summer 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Aug. 3, 2020",A,"A little about me: I took the 3-week version of this class as an incoming freshman.
As this was my first class at UCLA, I have no prejudices on which to judge between this course and others, so I thought my review might be helpful to some out there. 
I went into this class VERY afraid (all the poor reviews!), but Deb melted away a lot of my fears; she was very helpful and kind to people who asked questions, and she took her time to make sure everyone was on the same page before moving on from difficult topics.
PROS: - Very interested in helping students learn - Prompt responses to emails - Very funny and engaging in lecture - Great explanations of more difficult concepts
CONS: - Launchpad was a little bit finicky (especially for first-time user) - Some Launchpad quizzes covered content from the section after, so it's important to skim first and test later
I honestly liked the flipped classroom model; it was hard to get used to, but I eventually found it to be a good way to learn before and ask questions during lecture, and I think it's a tool that can and should be applied to all other classes. I will say that tests did not require much deep knowledge about topics, but they did require a lot more breadth, especially in terms of knowing how factors within a biological system can affect outcomes or processes within the system.
Overall, a great experience, and you get exactly what you put into the class."

The most boring professor I have encountered at UCLA. Avoid this professor at all costs. She assumes that you know everything because Launchpad should have covered it, but she is just awful at lectures. If you can avoid this professor do so. She does not offer past exams for students to review she does not look like the type of person that you would ask a question to. She got mad at people that didn't do her little arts and crafts project and took away credit from people that didn't do it, YOU THINK PRINTING IS FREE IN COLLEGE DEBRA?

Speaks too quickly and doesn't bother to explain, repeat or put emphasis or anything. Always sounded tired or treated us condescendingly.Course: Steer clear if you don’t need to take 7A. DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A GE. There are pervasive flaws with the LS 7 series format. Prof Pires, the creator of the LS 7 series, seems to be convinced that her methodology is revolutionary and incontestably superior.Extremely disappointed with this course and the LS core. No transparency at all. They just made dealing with the Coronavirus situation more stressful and disorienting.

The lecturer: Prof Pires- Her manner of speech when giving lectures is constantly very nonchalant, unenthusiastic, and disconnected. This meant that I never knew what was important to write down and what wasn't. She also doesn't repeat anything or properly explain diagrams, just drops info and moves on.- If you miss something she said, you have to wait until lecture's uploaded to BruinCast to catch up AND can't follow anything she says for the next few slides.- Both Prof Pires and Prof Pyle (who co-taught this course) have unreasonable expectations in terms of recalling all of that day's LaunchPad* material on the spot. In class, they will drop a term and say ""Remember X from LaunchPad? Yeah, so..."" and continue without caring to recap or explain.- Both Prof Pires and Prof Pyle also dumb down their explanations for Clicker questions. This meant that I could get the idea of the explanation but was not given the proper way to write it down or explain it in a scientifically accurate way.*LaunchPad = online platform that hybridizes an ebook with quizzes. You need it for points (a PDF of the book will not cut it).
ON THE CORONAVIRUS SITUATION: Prof Pires was irresponsible and not at all transparent of the situation. She spent six days ""figuring out solutions"" without updating students, only to not change anything other than make it online. Anxiety ran free those six days, coming from someone rarely anxious at all. Furthermore, Prof Pires and the LS core only made the final optional after much pressure from the students and a letter from the Academic Senate addressed to faculty in general.And whereas other lecturers for 7A (e.g. Prof Lazzazera) allowed getting the highest grade of three options as a final exam score (taking the final and using the final exam's score OR midterm average OR prorating) -- a recommendation to faculty also outlined by the Academic Senate -- , Prof Pires did not stick to the standardization of the LS 7 series and determined that the final exam's score would be determined either by taking the final OR the better of midterm average or prorating. Prof Pires seems to only follow the series's patterns when it suits her."

I had taken biology in high school and thought that it would be the same in college, but there’s much more depth to it. With that being said, my only complaint with the class was that I thought the tests were more difficult than they had to be. It wasn’t because of the material but because of the wording. Other than that, I thought Debra was fair. She can be direct sometimes, but otherwise she is quite kind. Going to lecture is important for more than just clicker questions. This practice is definitely similar to what you will see on the test, so may sure you take advantage of it."

The midterms/finals were hard because you not only had to have a thorough knowledge of all the material, but also know how to apply them. Also, imo, launchpad wasn't too helpful because often times it was just an info overload. A lot of the material on launchpad was not on the midterms/finals so it's easy to study the wrong things"

She honestly explains the concepts really really well, but if you have trouble with understand some of the concepts, GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS! Honestly I think I went to her OH every week, and it's almost impossible to not understand a concept after she's thoroughly explained it. She is also a really nice person, and you can tell she honestly wants to help you understand the concepts. I would absolutely recommend taking her!"

The materials were pretty easy for me, but maybe because I've taken AP Biology in high school and most of the concepts in this class were covered then. The exams were all multiple choice and pretty straight-forward, as long as you listen in the lecture and understand all the clicker questions then you should be fine. Deb doesn't grade on a curve, so you'll get what you deserve at the end of the class. 
One thing that is super helpful if you find that you're not so good with biology: go. to. her. office. hours!!! I went a couple of times last quarter but there were maximum 7-8 students the entire 2 hours despite the 300-students lectures. Again she's really good at explaining the concepts to her students, so it's really helpful to ask her questions! 
Overall this was a really good class and a good professor, and I definitely would take her again for any future classes. The only reason I didn't get an A is because I sort of slacked off before the final because I got really good grades on both midterms (so now you know what not to do lol). 
The only thing that I had to complain about (not this class) but the LS7 series is that you HAVE to get launchpad - it was really pricey and I already had a copy of the textbook, but since you have to do practice problems and activities every week, launchpad is absolutely mandatory. 
Other than that this was a really good class!"

That being said, if you don't do Launchpad at all, you're screwed. Deb was really cool early on but after the first midterm she picked up her lecture pace and did not explain a lot of clicker questions well enough. She also sometimes comes off as condescending and mean if you ask her questions directly. In the end, it really doesn't matter what professor you have because you end up teaching yourself everything. Just make sure to understand all the Launchpad practice exam questions, clickers, and half sheets they give in lecture. Launchpad is also free points because everything's on quizlet just look it up."

Overall I don't really think it matters which professor you have since the test and material are all universal for this series so I guess take Deb if you don't want a professor who completely disregards clicker question explanation altogether.

Debra B Pires,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2018,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 27, 2018",A,"Deb's class consisted entirely of clicker questions- including ones where even the TA's would get it wrong because her questions are structured mostly to trick you- and discussing her complete lack of a closet. I hadn't taken bio since freshman year in high school, where I disliked it, and while this class wasn't awful material wise for me, most of the people I know who loved biology before ended up hating it because of her class. Don't ever miss launchpad, pair up with people for your practice questions and check quizlet for them, and ask your TA for clarification on your discussion worksheets; conserve every non-test point you can. She added 10 points of extra credit at the end if you did surveys, which is equivalent to 5 questions on the final. Launchpad is not a good method to study because it oversaturates you with information, instead go to your TA's office hours and focus on the learning objectives. My TA is easily one of the only reasons I passed the class, without her I am sure I would've been drowning. Overall the class isn't too bad though some weeks made barely any sense and Deb makes it clear that the lecture's purpose is not to teach you material, it is to reinforce your understanding. If you ask a question in class, god be with you because she can be incredibly condescending. Honestly my best advice is to find some friends and teach the material to each other as much as you can, and make a game out of guessing which outfit she'll wear next (you've got a 1 in 3 chance of being right). Also the class is not curved so be nice to everyone around you, they're all super stressed out and could use some kindness."

However, after figuring out your learning style and how to learn everything by yourself, this class becomes way easier. The lectures themselves are useless.

Never ever forget to do your Launchpad homework, go to class or discussion, because it adds up. You could get A+'s on midterms and finals and still get a B overall trust me.

There weekly graded quizzes, but they're online and you get a couple tries, so its easy to work with other people and get good grades. Pires also offers a little extra credit if you do pre-class worksheets before each class, which I highly recommend because the material is very helpful too.

Debra B Pires,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2017,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 11, 2018",B,I felt this class was pretty difficult being a first-year University student. A lot of the material was jam-packed and went through so quickly that it became difficult to understand at times. That being said there were extra credit points for doing pre-class assignments and points for doing the readings so you definitely had some wiggle room on the midterms. I also feel like her office hours were somewhat helpful but only if you want further information.... she won't explain a whole concept to you. I learned a lot of the information needed for this class from being in a PLF and from my TA who was amazing!! Overall this class was difficult if you had no previous AP biology experience and just having taken a regular class in high school is not going to help you.
Debra B Pires,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2017,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Jan. 28, 2018",A-,"Dr. Pires is a very interactive professor. She provides everything a student may need to succeed in this class -- extra credit assignments, small homework assignments that can boost your grade, and review sessions before midterms and finals. You read and complete worksheets before class so that you have some knowledge of the material before the actual lecture. The lectures are also bruincast.
That being said, LS7A squeezes a lot of information into a short time period, and so it can be easy to become overwhelmed or fall behind. I would recommend not only going to her office hours, but going to your TA's office hours for a more in-depth explanation on confusing topics.

You purchase the textbook online and read all your material before class and take review quizzes. The amount of material varies, but it usually took about 1 hour to read and annotate everything. After each week, you get online practice exam questions, which are what I think was the hardest part of the class. The textbook is also used for LS 7B and 7C, so it's worth purchasing for an entire year. She doesn't use a curve to grade, so every point you get matters, but you do get 10 easy extra credit points by doing a pre-class worksheet, which is honestly really helpful for reviewing. She said that she does curve however, if the class average is below 75%, so in this case, a curve will only help you.Another thing that might affect this class is which TA you have. Each week, there's an 8 point discussion worksheet that needs to be filled out during discussion. It can be helpful to have a nice TA, otherwise you could lose points that were otherwise easy to get. Other than that, this class is very manageable and the professor is very helpful and approachable."
Debra B Pires,Lifesci 7A,Cell and Molecular Biology,Fall 2017,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 23, 2017",A-,"The curriculum is taught in a flipped structure, which means you are expected to self-teach yourself the material before lecture (same for Roth-Johnson). During lecture, Deb briefly reviews the materials, but focuses mainly on clicker questions to reinforce the topics taught. The clicker questions count towards in-class participation and attendance.
The required materials are an iClicker (doesn't matter which model), and access to Biology: How Life Works on LaunchPad. This is ~$95 for 24 months access (I think 7B and 7C uses the same text). This is the online textbook to learn the materials and answer homework questions/practice quizzes/tests. Homework load isn't bad if you don't procrastinate. 
Extra credit is earned by completing the Pre-Class Worksheet before each lecture and submit it online to CCLE. This helped a lot, considering it was worth an extra 10 pts each week.
Discussion is mandatory and the worksheets and activities completed during section counts toward overall grades.
There are two midterms and one final. The questions are mostly all True/False questions, which makes it very tricky. Make sure you not only understand the concepts, but make connections to other topics and know how to apply it. Pure memorization does not help a lot during the tests, since almost all of the questions are applications.
Deb is an extremely nice professor who is there to help her students during lecture and office hours. If you put in effort in pre-class assignments, this class should be easy!"

This means that the majority of how well you learn the material is on you. During lecture, Deb spends most of her time asking us clicker questions, meaning it is pretty much expected of you to read the material and understand it by the time class starts. That being said, she still gives a brief lecture on the material you should've read previously. There is extra credit, and the extra credit is SUPER easy. Although it doesn't add up to much (10 points total), it doesn't hurt to do it. The extra credit assignments go along with the textbook readings and are helpful to do and go over before midterms and finals.To me, Deb's tests were tricky at first. There are a lot of true/false questions and her tests contain the type of questions that really apply the concepts you have read and learned about into different situations. What I mean by this is, this is not a class you'll do well in if you're just gonna memorize everything. You really need to UNDERSTAND the concepts well in order to do well on the tests.But, you get used to the tests and the class isn't so bad!

(But I guess all of the professors of 7A assign the same homeworks) Also, she offers learning goals which help us to know what knowledge should we know after taking the classes. I have never fall asleep in her class. She may not be the best professor a UCLA, but she is definitely not the worst. Also, as long as you pay reasonable amount of effort to the course ( not huge amount), you will be fine, she is definitely not a professor who will effect your score or GPA negatively."
Jennifer Casey,Chem 14A,"Atomic and Molecular Structure, Equilibria, Acids, and Bases",Spring 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 6, 2020",A+,"FOR CHEM14AE SPRING 2020: From the pandemic to the recent tension affecting our lives and communities, this quarter has been particularly challenging for all of us. While many professors have adjusted their courses and attitudes to fit the obstacles many students are currently facing, few have been as kind and accommodating as Dr. Casey. There is no other class that students are taking in which the instructional team rejoices in class memes, offers office hours on the weekend, struggles with balloons for our education’s sake and understands, uplifts and encourages all of us to succeed. When I look back on how much we’ve learned over the past quarter, we have done an exceptional amount of learning thanks to the dedication of the instructional team. It is sometimes easy to forget, but at the bare core, professors and TAs do not have a specific obligation to care deeply about student wellbeing or pay an extraordinary amount of detail in creating intentional and meaningful coursework, especially for an online pilot class during a turbulent time in our society! However, Dr. Casey and the TAs/LAs have gone above and beyond in purposefully and passionately fulfilling those additional duties this quarter, all while cultivating a positive environment during class. Dr. Casey mentioned some time during the quarter that in the best case scenario, she hoped that all of us would end the class thinking chemistry is fun. Well, after Chem14AE with her, I’m glad to say that chemistry is fun (most of the time)! Although I personally really like the quarter system, this is one of the few times I actually wish we were on the semester system. This class has been my favorite class I have taken at UCLA so far, and I’m actually sad that it is coming to an end so soon. I’ll miss reading everyone’s responses to the opening question, writing sassy responses on the lab worksheets with my team and feeling just a little more happiness in the world when Dr. Casey’s face lights up in fascination from chiweenies, carrots and random chemistry facts. It even gave me the final push to switch my major to something chem-related. What happens in this course truly is the best of UCLA, and why I love going to this school so much. I recommend everyone take this class with her.
During a normal quarter, the grade breakdown may be as follows (could change in the future):Surveys 5 points (1%)Homework 50 points (10%)Clicker Questions 40 points (8%) <--you have more than enough opportunities to earn these 40 pointsPre-Discussion Quizlet 45 points (9%) <--lowest one is droppedLearn Before Lecture 45 points (9%) <--lowest one is droppedDiscussion Worksheets 90 points (18%) <--was made out of 80 points this quarter, there were nine worksheets worth 90 points, you can miss up to 10 points to still get full credit, collaborative with lab group+LA, includes reflectionsCalibrated Peer Review 30 points (6%) <--was replaced with a group essay this quarter, not too bad, 500-600 words!Quizzes 45 points (9%) <--solitary, timed, closed book/note, lowest quiz is droppedMidterm 50 points (10%) <--collaborative with lab group, open book/note, timedFinal Exam 100 points (20%) <--was replaced with a cumulative discussion worksheet this quarter due to academic senate, collaborative with the lab group and class, open book/note, not timedTotal 500 points (There are extra credit opportunities provided as well.)
This class heavily relies on group work. You'll come to love it and your team. During discussion sections, LAs are placed with teams of four to guide you through the worksheets. This class can be challenging at times if you do not have a strong chemistry foundation, but there is a huge support system and is extremely rewarding. This class covers way more material than the regular Chem14 series but will prepare you for later courses in the series. However, you won't be spending endless hours on weekly assignments, all of which are extremely useful for coming to lecture prepared and doing well in the class. There are less weekly homework assignments than a typical science class because there is an additional hour added to discussions, which might seem terrible on the surface, but you'd rather suffer through the material with help from peers, LAs, TAs and the professor than by yourself late at night. Everything is very intentional and meaningful in this class. You MUST attend lecture. Classes are not recorded. However, you will enjoy coming to class. It's actually fun (even though we were online)! The instructional team does EVERYTHING in its power to try to help you succeed. Don't cut yourself short by not taking advantage of the resources (office hours, study lounges, LA workshops, videos, piazza discussion forum, etc.) they provide. I wish I would have known how amazing this class was going to be (I had zero clue going in), so I could have savored every moment. Good luck!"

Chemistry in general is difficult but she breaks it down into much simpler topics for us to understand. If you have the oppurtunity to take the AE class, I would HIGHLY recommend it. Though there is ""extra"" class time, the extra discussion time is really essential to developing accurate conclusions and properly learning the material. You can think of it as less time needed for studying as you are essentially reviewing the material during discussion. Anyways, if anything I'd highly recommend that you take Casey for Chem14, as the grading is pretty lenient and you can still get an A in the class after a low grade on one either the midterm or final."
Jennifer Casey,Chem 14A,"Atomic and Molecular Structure, Equilibria, Acids, and Bases",Fall 2017,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted May 3, 2018",A,"To put it simply: an absolutely amazing professor. Although CHEM14A with her covered a lot more material than with other professors, I do not regret taking this class with her. Dr. Casey gave amazing lectures and did everything in her power to give her students the opportunity to succeed. Her midterms and final were extremely fair, the homework is optional (but you should definitely do all of the homework), and her office hours were the most helpful office hours I've ever been to at UCLA. If Dr. Casey teaches CHEM14A again, do yourself a favor and take the class with her; you will leave her class with a newfound appreciation for chemistry and a strong foundation for the rest of the chemistry series here at UCLA."

Even though it was during a six-week summer session, the class was very understandable thanks to Dr. Casey's in-depth explanations. Definitely go to her office hours, Casey is very approachable and wants you to succeed. The exams are challenging but fair. We also had a group final exam during discussion, which was more difficult, and your grade in that is dependent on the ability of your group. The textbook is confusing, so I would recommend going over the discussion worksheets and slides to better understand the content."
Jennifer Casey,Chem 14A,"Atomic and Molecular Structure, Equilibria, Acids, and Bases",Spring 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 30, 2019",A,"Casey is an absolute sweetheart. She jointly taught with Prado and Caram for our 14A class when our original professor bounced unexpectedly. There were kinda two camps of students: those that had taken AP Chem and seen 90% of what we were doing and those that this was completely new to. I was of the former, and, because of it, didn't have to do much work. The class used iclicker points based partially on if you were correct , but there are enough opportunities that you could probably never be right and still get full points. There's homework but it is not collected and I didn't find it or the book helpful in the slightest so I never utilized those. There were weekly quizzes that were awful for the first two because the time crunch was impossible, but after students voiced their concerns our instructors were completely receptive and adapted the remaining quizzes; they were then pretty easy. The midterms were a mixed bag: one had a low D average and the other had a mid B average (made easier to compensate for the first one). I got a 90% and 94% on the midterms, but then got an 81% on my final. Because we had lost the first week, the ending was kinda crammed so the final focused on a concept that I knew I didn't really understand all that well. The average was a 70%. The class was ultimately curved a couple percentage points in our favor I believe, because my raw score was an A- and I received an A. Honestly if you're worried about 14A, don't be. It's entirely do-able as long as you maintain responsibility for understanding the material. Casey is a fantastic lecturer, easily able to explain concepts at their simplest level and build it up slowly so anyone can understand. She's funny and warm and never makes anyone feel unwelcome or shut down. She is also so in-tune with her students and can sense confusion without anyone even saying anything and adapts the course in response. I would take her again in a heartbeat."

Get to know her! She gives off mom vibes! It's so comforting when youre a depressed freshman to know that there's a professor that actually cares about you and knows your name. I got lucky with her!

Her questions are confusing and meant to trip you up, which as an incoming freshman is not conducive to a positive first quarter experience. Her class had me questioning my major and if I even deserved to go to UCLA. Her lecture style is pretty boring and her slides don't have nearly enough detail.

The pdf of the textbook is on the ucla textbook page for free. I would recommend buying the solutions manual for the homework problems as they are helpful step by step guides and taught me more than anything else. Always do all of the problems recommended.

Laurence Lavelle,Chem 14A,General Chemistry for Life Scientists I,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 26, 2021",A,"I took this class fall quarter of my freshman year which was online due to covid and I'm currently in 14B with Lavelle. Even though there are already a lot of reviews for Lavelle and this class, I'm gonna try to make this as unbiased as I can.
For context: I've taken honors and AP chemistry in high school so going into this class I was already pretty well versed on general chemistry but I'm gonna try to write this with consideration of those who have little to no background in chemistry.
Pros:-Lavelle is one of the most caring and compassionate professors I've had so far and I think it's so evident even if you dont like him for other reasons you cant deny that this man truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Every email he sends is so heartwarming and filled with smiley faces. He is constantly encouraging students and assisting them on chemistry community in any way that he can. He even filmed all the lectures in the normal lecture hall to give us the sense that we were on campus which was a small effort but one that I think a lot of people appreciated. He also plays music at the beginning of every lecture and jams out. 10/10 Very wholesome. And he gave a lot of bonus points both in 14A and 14B (bonus questions on the midterm and an extra 10 points on the 14A final just to be kind even though he didnt have to because the average was already pretty high)
-Sooooo many resources provided by Lavelle. Basically any time of the day you want to get help you can attend an Undergraduate Assistant or TA office hours on zoom for help. Or you can ask on Chemistry Community and your question will be answered by another student relatively quickly.
Cons:-The main con I would say is that Lavelle isnt the best lecturer. You can tell that he is very enthusiastic about what he teaches but his delivery isn't the most student friendly in the sense that he doesn't convey information the most clearly. I can say this with confidence because I'll often think back to how I learned it in high school from my AP chem teacher and see that he couldve explained it much better/clearer if he had simply done in so-and-so way instead. He's definitely not the worst lecturer but there have been times where I was confused on what he was saying even though I've learned it before.
-He always goes way over time in (virtual/recorded) lectures. Almost every lecture will be around 55 min and at least once or twice a week (out of 3 total lectures per week) they will be over an hour long. I think theyve only been under 50 minutes a few times total each quarter. This is annoying when you consider the fact that the lectures would probably be a lot shorter if they were more concise and straight to the point.
-Lack of examples in lectures is another annoying con. I feel like most students learn better by doing and seeing the concepts being applied/in action. Instead we have to do all that by ourselves in the homework and textbook problems which is annoying because for people with little to no chemistry background those problems can seem insanely difficult/confusing to do on your own the first time. When we learned electrochemistry, he barely taught us how to balance redox reactions but then all the homework problems were way more difficult and complex and required concepts he never even mentioned before in class. If I didn't have my notes from AP chemistry then I would not have been able to do them and I feel bad for the students who had to figure it out on their own because of this.
Other notes:-The sapling homework and textbook assignments are very reflective of the exam difficulty. The midterms and exams are completely fair and not tricky at all. People just love to exaggerate in the GroupMe and say they are hard but truthfully, they are not. The averages are always 80% or above. TIP: do the textbook problems 2-3 days before the exam because you can always count on seeing AT LEAST one question copied word for word from the textbook. On one midterm prof explicitly stated that 30% of the midterm questions would be from the textbook.
-If you've taken AP chemistry in high school and didn't suck at it, you will be totally fine in this class. Itll be mainly review of AP chem. Just put in the time and effort and you will get an A. Near the end of 14A I slacked off a little to focus on my other classes and as a result I scored a little lower than normal on the final but that was expected and all my mistakes were silly ones that I could've corrected if I had just put in a little more time. The point: if you stay on top of things you'll be set.
-If you've never taken any chemistry before or only have taken a low level chemistry class in high school, honestly you're probably gonna struggle a little. There were people in my class who have never taken any chemistry before so you definitely wont be the only one but it wont be easy. If I took this class with Lavelle without any background in chem I probably wouldnt have gotten an A. Even though he starts off each new unit with ""review"" before moving onto the newer concepts, it still doesnt really make up for having previous chemistry knowledge. There are some things that he will simply assume you already know like molarity, how to do dimensional analysis/converting between units, what the numbers on the periodic table mean, basic polyatomics, and much more. That being said I don't know if other ""better"" professors will go over these things either since they are considered so fundamental to chemistry. 
-DONT overlook the conceptual concepts in each unit. Even though most of the homework and textbook problems are calculation problems (depending on how math-y the unit was) the exam always has a good amount of conceptual questions which generally shouldnt be an issue if you have a good understanding of the concepts we learn and understand WHY something is happening."
Laurence Lavelle,Chem 14A,General Chemistry for Life Scientists I,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted July 28, 2021",C+,"There probably is another ring in Dante's Inferno specifically for Dr. Lavelle. 
This man has an ego the size of the g*ddamn eiffel tower and thinks he is gods gift to the world. (ex: first day of class he played rock music or something at the beginning of class and people began to cheer thinking it would be a fun class and he literally stood in the center of the class and held out his arms as if they were giving him a standing ovation for curing cancer..) 
He loves to stress how many hours of extra help are offered but neglects to mention that if you don't either know EVERYTHING from AP chem or go to ALL 23 hours/week, you wont do well in this class. 
He always sped through lectures and didn't give out his slides so you couldn't go back and look at them if you missed something and he always wrote problems on the board knowing damn well that >75% of the class couldn't see the board... 
He was soo obsessed with ""chemistry community"" basically a discussion forum where he forced us to post questions and answer them to get our participation and acted as if that was a substitute for him teaching, he wouldn't post solutions to problems and act as if he was helping us figure them out for ourselves, or that chemistry community would take care of it somehow but again neglected the fact that we had to answer questions to get credit so half the answers on there were just wrong (not people trying to sabotage you though just most people didn't understand it themselves and needed credit or even those people that *thought* they understood it and were actually trying to be helpful were often wrong). 
Take this class with a different professor."

Lavelle's lectures are clear but boring and he talks really slow. But that's not even relevant. The material feels easy/manageable during lecture and the sapling assignments. In fact, you feel like you actually understand the material! But the tests are literally the hardest tests I've ever taken. Lavelle came out and said he wrote the final to be too hard and he curved it. Still only raised my F to a D, though. Anyway, he provides a lot of study sessions with TA and LAs so definitely attend those, especially workshops. Set-ups are pretty rudimentary and not helpful for tests because the tests are anything but rudimentary. It's a shame Lavelle has been teaching here for decades and yet still thinks treating Chem 14A as a weeder is a good way to inspire undergrads, especially freshmen.

He constantly mentions his extra help UA sessions and they are so helpful. And later in the quarter I really felt that he cared for the students as he boosted our final exam scores by 10 points when it was really hard. His class is not a free A, but it is a very doable A if you watch lectures, go to at least 1 UA session a week, do all the textbook practice problems (he includes some in his tests).Stats: MT1 100%, MT2 100%, Final 83%"

There is barely any mandatory class homework. However, for this class you really have to put in a lot of work yourself if you don't have a strong chemistry background. The tests are very similar to the textbook problems so I suggest even if it is not mandatory to do all of the textbook problems. The lectures are asynchronous which is nice but make sure to stay on top of watching them and take notes of everything. The hardest part about it being online is that the tests are multiple choice and short so if you miss more than one question you are already at a B. Tests are also proctored on zoom with your TA. Although you need to put a lot of work into this class it is very rewarding. There are also tons and tons of resources if you are confused on anything."
Laurence Lavelle,Chem 14A,General Chemistry for Life Scientists I,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 24, 2021",A,"Lavelle goes above and beyond to make every resource possible available to his students and he's proud of it. Some find it annoying when he repeatedly mentions the UA review sessions, Step-up sessions, office hours, etc, etc that are offered, but honestly, it always made me smile. He truly cares about student understanding and it shows. At the beginning of the quarter when students said they liked the music he played before lecture, he decided to DJ for us every class. He dances around and vibes; it's amazing. 
Exams are proctored by your TA over Zoom. The exams are 1 hour long. Each question is worth a significant part of your grade so missing just 1 or 2 will cost you a lot of points. I did well on the 1st and 2nd midterm but the final was HARD. Content-wise I understood the final but the timing was off, and I was really pushing it to finish. The class is graded on a straight grading scale with no curving (he did give us an extra 10 points on the final but he said this wasn't common).
How to do well in this class: - Go to the UA sessions. Personally, these were the most helpful resource for me. - Do the assigned (but not mandatory) textbook probs because some will show up on the exams - Listen in lecture (but watch on x1.5 speed because he almost always goes overtime by at least 10 min)"

Prof Lavelle is a great professor, he has plenty of resources and always encourages communication between the students on chemistry community, a website he made. However, as someone who does not have any AP Chem background or has not seen any of the material presented in this class prior, unlike half the other students, it was difficult. I never developed proper study methods for STEM classes in high school and as a result, suffered. The exams get harder. The final was awful, maybe because of the transition to online format? There were reviews the week of, but they were not very helpful if you actually watched the lectures since they were a simple recap. The textbook is very helpful, especially the textbook problems. Basically, use as many resources as possible; managing time with the class can be difficult, but it's possible."

His explanations are really concise and thorough and Chemistry Community, which is an website where you can ask questions at any time, is so helpful because you can get instant feedback if you're stuck on a question from other classmates. He also has workshops and step-up sessions beyond normal office hours that can help a lot if you need more practice. Since your grade is mainly the midterm and final, I really recommend doing practice problems from the textbook (some which are on the tests) early because if you procrastinate like I did your test scores will drop your grade a lot. I also think that he occasionally extends lecture times a little too long (at most by 20 minutes). The class overall is challenging but as long as you make sure to keep up with the practice problems and go to office hours every time you have a question, you'll do well."
Laurence Lavelle,Chem 14A,General Chemistry for Life Scientists I,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 15, 2021",A,"I think Lavelle is an amazing professor. A lot of people will complain about him because the content is difficult (it definitely can be), but I can't imagine a professor doing more than Lavelle does to make sure students have every resource they need for the class. I didn't attend many UA sessions besides the review ones before exams, but I've heard they are extremely helpful if you are struggling to grasp a concept. In his lectures, Lavelle is constantly mentioning how he goes back to fundamentals before he teaches a new concept, and it is actually really helpful for people like me who have forgotten everything from high school chemistry. His midterms are very reasonable in my opinion and he moves at a good pace. As long as you are able to do the Sapling and textbook problems he assigns you should be more than set for the exams."

He served as our guest lecturer this morning; throughout the lecture, students were just messaging in our class group chat about how AMAZING he was. He was funny, explained things in ways my 12-year-old brother could understand, and was super engaging. As everyone left the lecture hall, I saw countless people with their jaws dropped and basically screaming to their friends about how they couldn't believe they just experienced such a quality lecture. I'm pretty sure people even begged Professor Pham to continue ""guest lecturing"" for the rest of the quarter."

The TAs were cool too. Definitely a doable class given the difficult rep that Organic Chem has. He also gives extra credit (like 8 points) if you do the polling question during each lecture. It definitely bumps your grade up a lot if you do them (but you have to get the questions right). He gives weekly problem sets which are graded kinda harshly, but you get a whole week to do them and you can collaborate on them. Exams are in the same format as the Problem Sets, and can either be harder, easier, or the same level as the Problem Sets, its kinda a gamble. But overall, they weren't too different. He gives suggested homework problems, which are good for concept but don't help a ton if you want the style of problems he gives on the exam. TA Worksheets are immensely helpful, people in my class would do them for other TAs too because the questions are more relevant to what you learn in the class. Overall, pretty good class."

I would definitely recommend doing practice problems almost every night/keeping up with the material in general. Ochem builds on itself, so it's really important to constantly review. I took this course 2 times, and the first time I actually dropped the class week 9 because I hadn't been keeping up with material and didn't understand a lot of concepts on the test.

If you approach the class in a way where you just do the minimum, maybe just showing up to lecture and doing BACON homework, then you will get the minimum benefit from the class. Obviously, sometimes that is how you have to approach the class, but if you have the chance to get to know this amazing professor, not only will your grade improve but you will be able to see just how dedicated and how seriously he wants his students to understand the concepts. He will have full on conversations about a topic that will go out of the scope of the class which is GREAT because with the way this series is structured and with how complex ochem is, knowing more will only help you in every way. Pham knows just about every answer to any question you may have and the best part of his explanations is that it isn't a high school answer where you just have to take the answer as it is because the teacher said it's true. He will give you the why and then everything about your knowledge of anything will just click. I don't know how he does it but that was my experience. If you are only focused on getting a good grade in a class, maybe you can do it on your own or in a study group, but if you actually want to just know more about chemistry or Pham's life because he has cool stories, then I would make an effort to go to office hours or the one-on-one sessions. Do what you can to get him as your teacher because UCLA students couldn't be luckier to have Pham grace us with his presence in a rigorous and intense 14 series, pre-med environment."

I came out of 14A and 14B with Lavelle, and I was so used to learning nothing in lecture, doing ALL of the homework, and then coming to tests that were totally unfair. Professor Pham, however, was so refreshing. The lectures were incredibly helpful and I spent the entire time paying my full attention and writing down EVERYTHING he said (especially the conceptual stuff he explains because this *will* help you understand everything better). He is so entertaining but he lectures QUICKLY, so don't zone out.
Biggest advice for this class: pay 200% of your attention during lecture, find old tests (the formatting is similar to old tests -- he makes the tests harder every quarter but they're still really fair), do TA worksheets (textbook is largely useless so this will be the best practice material), go to TA/Pham's office hours if you need explanations (he can go quickly in lecture but he will help clarify everything during OHs), and don't scare yourself (OChem has a bad reputation, but be confident that you can do this!!). 
Dr. Pham made this class so enjoyable, because he's so interesting (ask him about his favorite musicals and/or his escape room in Irvine), passionate, genuinely cares about students' learning (don't ask him about grades and what'll be on the test... he hates when students do this lol), and this class is fair. Also, he offers SO much extra credit. I strongly recommend taking it with him! :)

He posts the lecture slides and uploads the audio for each lecture so it's possible to review his materials before each exam. However, like one of the other reviews stated, while he is a funny professor, he can sound condescending at times and believes that you either have an innate talent for organic chemistry or you don't. 
The class itself is difficult but that's no surprise. Homework is not required, but to be fair, the test materials don't mirror the homework questions. Rather, it is an opportunity to see if you the general gist behind how to solve the problems. The tests are fair, but my advice is to look up old tests if possible and do the TA worksheets. The class average my quarter was a 76%, but this is a ""weeder"" class, so just do your best and hope for the best. Good luck."

He's a little hard to approach sometimes with questions (he directly confronts your understanding of the topic in order to see if you can answer your own question), but office hours can clear up some of those questions. Be warned - this class is NOTHING like 14A/B. It is far more visual and has very little calculations in it, and this makes it harder for some people (it did for me). To do well in the class, don't even bother opening up the textbook (the problems look very unlike the ones you'll be seeing on his tests) - try to find the couple good TAs and do their worksheets and do the LA worksheets given out before the midterms/final. The tests are all pretty hard, but they are generally fair. He also gives out a lot of extra credit through Top Hat (basically clicker questions) and on his tests (often info about himself and/or something from Fun Fridays, where he goes over an interesting development in chemistry).

Prof Pham is a fantastic prof and he really doesn't ask a lot from you. I know organic chemistry is known as a ""hard class"", but this was the exact contrary. The only thing someone might struggle with is the HNMR stuff, but next to that it's really an easy class with not a lot of work.Professor Pham's tests cover exactly what he teaches you in class, so know all the little details he mentions in class because he loves to test you on that. Next to that, the tests are very fair. Our averages on the midterms were very high (around 79%).also: Professor Pham really tries everything to get your grade as high as possible. There is a ton of extra credit and I really mean a ton. You could usually get around 8 points of extra credit per midterm (graded out of 100 points although the midterm itself was 102 points, so he gave you two other points as a present), we received another 15 points of extra credit for filling out evaluations AND at the end, professor Pham bumped up your grade if you were 1-2 points from the next grade boundary.So all this extra credit stuff is great, BUT professor Pham is also an incredible teacher. I adored going to lecture because he made everything so clear and explained all in a very entertaining way. You know these classes that feel like sixty hours? This class is the exact opposite.I would take Pham again if I could and would really really recommend him to anyone who wants a good grade in chem and learn a lot!"
Hung V Pham,Chem 14C,Structure of Organic Molecules,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 10, 2019",A,"Pham is a very good organic chemistry professor. He tells you exactly what you're learning, how to do it, and what to do. The problem is, organic chemistry is pretty difficult. 
He compensates for this by giving a TON of extra credit. When I say a ton I mean I got an 85,87 on my midterms, a 91 on the final and finished with a solid A because of how much extra credit he gives. The exams are hard but similar to past ones. I'd expect him to start to change it up a bit because reusing past exam formats will only increase average test scores over time.
But 14C seriously challenged me. This is not 14B meaning that you can't just plug and chug formulas and memorize things. YOU HAVE TO KNOW ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, and Pham is an excellent professor to get you there.
Be warned: He can come off as a little condescending if you ask a question, but the students that he knows he is very very kind to. He genuinely cares even though while you're talking to him it might not look like it."

Dr Pham was able to change that within the first week -- he made the lectures fun and engaging while also succinctly explaining the information. He does go pretty fast through the lectures, but if you practice for just a little while right after each lecture and stay on top of the material, this class should be just fine. It's really obvious that Pham wants his students to do well, and while his tests are difficult, they're very fair, and he's more than happy to discuss them with you during the many office hours he has. I'm really reluctant to go to office hours, but he's approachable and friendly and they're truly so helpful. I got a C- on the first midterm because I never did practice problems, but I was able to get an A on the second by doing practice worksheets from the TAs and the LAs every day, as well as going to a few office hours to clear up my more specific questions. Going into the final I did the same thing, and ended up getting an 88 which gave me an A- in the class. Extra credit is offered through in-class clicker questions and post-exam questionnaires, so don't forget to take advantage of those.

For example, he offers extra credit on clicker questions, bonus points on the exams, and extra credit if you complete surveys. Further, it is also relatively simple to get credit for BACON which is 9% of your overall grade. Another key to success is asking a ton of questions on Piazza/GroupMe, utilizing your TA's/LA's, attending office hours, and forming study groups. You do not want to do OChem alone so make sure to take advantage of all the resources available to you. To review for the tests, I went through old exams (he does not provide these), went through discussion worksheets, and went through the lecture slides (his lectures are Bruincasted). Also, make sure to take advantage of the LA Review Workshop/LA Review Worksheets for the midterms and finals. Overall, Dr. Pham is approachable, engaging, and relatable.

Dr. Pham definitely did his job in dispelling all those rumors and relating this class to everyday life. I’m not kidding when I say Pham will think of some silly analogy that will stick with you but explain chemistry concepts. He’s super fun, lively, and freakin’ hilarious. I really appreciated how Pham took time from Friday’s to present Fun Fridays, where he chose some fun/weird topics in chemistry to expose us to. He also has awesome chem shirts he wears that any student can appreciate. Although he can be pretty fun, he also finds a way to intertwine some life lessons into his class. As a student he generally thinks so much about academics, it was great to have a professor who encouraged us to explore interests outside of the classroom. Overall, this class may not be the easiest (you definitely have to do some practice whether it’s through the textbook, online, or discussion sections), Pham makes it tolerable. It’s very possible to get a 90 or above in his class and not feel overwhelmed at all. I would say go into this class without the rumors of ochem in the back of your mind and don’t be afraid!

Philip Chodrow,Comptng 16A,Python with Applications,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 26, 2020",A,"If you are deciding between professors for PIC16A, Phil should be your choice. He cares so much about his students - both in whether you're grasping concepts and actually learning and in your mental health. His emphasis was not on grades but more on actually learning the material - he drops your 2 lowest homework grades, 4 discussion grades (which you complete with the same group of one to two people through the whole quarter), and 5 quiz grades. So if you're not doing too hot one week, don't stress.
I came into the course not too confident in my coding skills (I only took one PIC class before this) but I had all the resources I needed to get through this class. Challenging, but not to the point of insane stress. I really liked the final project we did surrounding data science and machine learning - you complete this project by week 10 and is done with the same group from your discussion. I like that the project was based on the students' interests that were surveyed at the beginning of the quarter. It seemed like a lot when we were first introduced to it but a lot of the work for the project is done in discussion and through homework already. 
Campuswire was a huge helper for me in the class to ask questions about homework or other general questions. You could receive up to 2% extra credit from posting thoughtful questions and answers on there, and up to 3% through a short essay surrounding equity, justice, and algorithms.
Phil was always available and open for questions. He held office hours at normal hours and also later in the evening to accommodate for students in different time zones. If you emailed him he'd reply quite quickly and always obviously took time to respond thoughtfully. He also checked CampusWire frequently for questions to answer that other students couldn't answer.
The midterm and final did take much longer for me than the estimated time given, but I feel this is common for all 24hr tests at this point. He even emailed us after the final saying that he has heard this concern and would take that into consideration while grading (what a gem), and had a whole extra part on the final to explain your progress through this class as a way to give him more insight into you when he considers your final grade.
If you do take this class with Phil (which you should if you want to learn in a really engaging way), make sure to ask him for his memes."

Phil makes the material very simple to understand with intuitive and stylish lecture notes.
The only negative standing out was that the final was hard, but I wouldn't worry about that too much if planning to enroll with him in the future. This is because Phil seems to be constantly gauging student's learning and success with the material, and making changes that will only benefit students.

The class (during COVID) was structured as a flipped classroom so we had asynchronous lectures every MWF and a quiz on them due at midnight each of those days, but there was an optional live lecture on those days as well. The quizzes were only a few questions and help you to not fall behind. On TR we had discussions where we worked in groups (the same group for the whole quarter) to complete worksheets which really helped show if I was confused on a certain topic. During discussion the TA, professor, and LAs come through to check and see how you are doing and help you if you are stuck. The groups are really helpful since you get to know 1-2 students in the class and can go to them for help studying or if you get stuck on the homework. This is also your group for the mini project due at the end of week 10. The grading scheme gives a fair amount of dropped scores (2 of 8 homeworks, 7 of 27 quizzes, and 5 of 19 discussions) so if you couldn't attend or had a difficult situation it you're still able to do well even if you miss some stuff. There's extra credit offered for insightful questions on campuswire or a short paper on algorithms, equity, and justice.

Professor Chodrow makes sure that the students stay engaged with the material throughout the quarter, but not to the point where he overloads you with work.
If you have the opportunity to take this class with him, DO IT!"

The tests and quizzes are not hard at all. I would recommend taking a look at the syllabus he already has posted on his website probably if you are interested in what topics are taught in this class as it seems PIC 16A seems to differ based on the professor teaching it. I generally hated working in groups for discussions though and on the final project. If you hate group work maybe reconsider but otherwise, I have no complaints."

She has the enthusiasm and concern for her students that 90% of the professors here seem to have left back in grad school. She may be ever-so-slightly frazzled at times, but it just plays into the loopy astronomer persona and doesn't detract at all from the lectures (which any observant student can tell she puts a lot of time into creating).

What's sad is that I was not the only one in her class who felt this way about her. The Physics and Astronomy department needs to find someone more suitable to teach this class because the number of astrophysics majors is dwindling.

This course is also heavily based on the social system and politics of the United States. The way the course material is presented gives off a ""the US is all that matters in disability studies!"" vibe.

However, Naoz mostly did derivations of physics theory which left me, along with the majority of the class, extremely confused. They were completely unnecessary and did little to help teach us. Because of all the time spent on derivations, she fell behind the other classes in terms of material covered. We only covered SHM, electric field, electric force, electric potential, and capacitance. The other classes covered that as well as resistors and thermodynamics to name a few. These are things we need to know. The tests were pretty easy though. They were basically what the problem sets she posted were. Honestly, you could probably do well by just reading the book and doing the homework. Going to lecture will not help."

Prof. Rose makes her class very manageable to her students and she is very knowledgeable and articulate in her teaching. Her exams are not terribly difficult, and as long as you do your homework on time and understand the underlying concepts (not just computational things; abstract and fundamentals are equally, if not more important than computations in this class), you should be set to get yourself a nice A.

Walking out of this class, I'm convinced that I should probably major in math. Rose is actually the best professor of all time and I loved the way she did the class. I know flipped classroom doesn't work for everybody, but the fact that you learn the material twice really does help you solidify your understanding of the material. Her video lectures that you watch at home are amazing and she tries to write down what she does each step, or explains it. In live class, which act as basically an office hours, she is very open to answering questions and tries to make sure that everyone watching understands what is going on, each and every step of the way. Rose is also really patient, especially if someone doesn't understand a question. She tries to listen to their thought process, and instead of just giving them the right answer, she tries to fix the way they got to the incorrect answer. Her homework problems are not too bad, and can easily be finished in one sitting (might take 1-2 hours). I felt very prepared from the midterms just from watching the videos and attending lectures, and I felt that I really didn't need to study much out of class since she makes these difficult concepts so straightforward. 10/10 I would take this class again, and I'm waiting for her to teach 115A in the Spring."

Rose Morris-Wright,Math 33A,Linear Algebra and Applications,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Nov. 30, 2020",N/A,"Prof. Morris-Wright is definitely a great professor. During her recorded lectures that we have to watch before her live lectures, she explains the concepts in detail so it's much easier (though still a bit challenging because of the difficulty of the class) for us to understand them. In her live lectures, she goes over some confusing problems and answers questions people have which is also really helpful. 
The difficulty of her tests is very similar to that of the homework. There are no extremely hard problems that are designed to make you cry after the test. However, 33A is not an easy class and you do have to do a few extra practices in addition to the weekly homework (which is not that much) to get a good grade on the midterm. I think the most difficult part of her test are the true and false questions which involve lots of vague and conceptual stuff. But the textbook has tons of similar questions at the end of every chapter and as long as you practice them you will be fine. 
She's absolutely not one of those professors whose lectures are so vague that students have to relearn everything by themselves afterwards. She really cares about her students and does everything she can to help them. Overall I recommend taking her 33A."

The way of flipped-course teaching is awesome: we first learned about definitions and examples in pre-lec videos and questions, and then we post questions we find confusing for her to explain in the lecture with a more in-depth illustration. This way of teaching helps me a lot in the current remote setting. HW is short, though I personally think she left too few problems to get enough practice. Exams perfectly correspond to what we learned in class and most students can get a high score if they understand the concepts. Overall, I will definitely take Rose's class again!"

Rose Morris-Wright,Math 33A,Linear Algebra and Applications,Spring 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 24, 2021",A,"Rose was a clear and effective lecturer but in my opinion the class structure was not the best. It was a flipped classroom style, which meant we watched pre-recorded videos and/or read the textbook prior to class to answer questions from a pre-lecture quiz, and then we would come to lecture with questions to ask her. This may well have been a blessing for some students, but I personally hated this format since it de-emphasizes a student’s responsibility to show up to synchronous lectures. 
That is not to say that she was bad at teaching by any means; in fact, I think she’s one of the clearest and most succinct lecturers in all my years learning mathematics. Her answers to student questions sometimes get a bit too convoluted for my liking, but she always tries to explain all the concepts both visually and with multiple different methods. At least one of those explanations will make sense to you. If she’s still teaching when 33A goes back in person, I would highly recommend you sign up for her class!
There are a lot of reviews here that describe her point distributions and whatnot, so I’ll just give my opinions and thoughts on all the assignments:
Homework: questions right from the textbook. While the number of questions assigned is minimal, each problem takes a very long time to complete. She also makes us write down the textbook question statement, which I initially thought was irritating, but eventually I realised it made reviewing for tests so much easier, as I could just refer to the same problem-solving algorithm I used in the homework. Also, she claims to pick three or four random questions to grade, but you can actually see which ones will be selected as they are worth 3 points rather than 1 point on Gradescope. 
Discussion: Structurally, I found this to be the most annoying part of class. We were required to show up to a weekly discussion section to complete a discussion worksheet. While the worksheet itself was interesting and offered many interesting applications of and conceptuals insights into linear algebra, showing up was a nuisance. I wish she just gave us the worksheet and allowed us to complete it at any time before the due date on Friday.
Exams: In order to accommodate the online setting, she made them more conceptual so we could not just plug everything in Symbolab (however this was a very useful resource for carrying out tedious matrix multiplications). I had no idea what I was doing in the first few weeks of the class, so I struggled in studying for the first midterm (even though the average was 100%). However, I started doing some extracurricular studying (seriously, look up 3Blue1Brown Essence of Linear Algebra Series; he’s a lifesaver) and immediately understood the conceptual underpinnings of the class far better. The second midterm and final exams were harder, but I felt way more prepared for them. I got a 93% on Midterm 1, 100% on Midterm 2, and 93% on the Final.
TL;DR: Lecturers are not engaging but very informative. Homework assignments are long but straightforward. Tests are straightforward but extremely conceptual. Discussions are annoying but insightful.
Edit: I forgot to mention that Rose is a genuinely nice person. There were a bunch of us on the waitlist for 33A since the math department did not foresee such a large number of students that intended to take the class this quarter. She let all of us into the class!"

Professor Rose Morris-Wright is amazing! She's kind, helpful, and answers people's questions thoroughly. She makes it clear that she genuinely cares about her students' well-being and mental health. She also spent time showing us tangible ways to use the material we learned in class rather than just leaving it be some abstract, useless tool we'd never know how to use; one of our lectures in Week 10 was entirely dedicated to real applications of linear algebra.
**
There are 2 possible grading schemes in this class. The first one is the one that is automatically applied. The second one drops a midterm and is reserved for a logistical, health, or mental health reason, or family obligation that requires you to miss an exam or not to be able to do your best on an exam (however she does not ask for proof because she'd rather not be intrusive into the personal details of your life); you have to notify her that you want this scheme before the exam you anticipate being dropped.
Scheme 1: Pre-Class Quizzes (10%), Groupwork (10%), Written Homework (10%), Two midterm exams (each 20%), Final exam (30%)
Scheme 2: Pre-Class Quizzes (10%), Groupwork (10%), Written Homework (10%), Maximum of 2 midterm grades (30%), Final exam (40%)
**
This class is flipped classroom, which means you either watch pre-recorded videos or read the textbook chapter before each lecture. There are multiple choice pre-class quizzes about the material due before every lecture, and the 6 lowest scores are dropped. You also get multiple attempts per question, AND multiple submission attempts to do these so it's pretty easy to get 100% in this category in my opinion. Class lecture time was then spent on answering questions and clarifying concepts students were confused about, and sometimes expanding the ideas of the lesson. Admittedly some people just won't vibe with the flipped classroom model, and that's fine, to each their own. I personally however felt it worked fine for me, and I've heard from people who took the LS 7 series that Rose's version of flipped classroom is far superior to the LS version. Seeing the material multiple times helped me to wrap my head around it a bit better, especially since linear algebra can sometimes be a bit confusing. Rose was also quite clear and concise in her explanations, and she did a very good job clarifying things that people asked questions about in my opinion.
**
Groupwork was basically just one worksheet a week. It was usually done in discussion sections, and you worked with the same group from week to week. Attendance to discussion sections actually wasn't required, but if you intended not to attend discussion then you had to tell her at the beginning of the quarter (she has a survey to fill out at the beginning of the quarter where you can tell her this info). If you do this, she assigns you to a group of students who also don't attend discussions, and your group can arrange to complete the worksheet on your own time. Personally, my group and I attended discussion as it was more convenient to ask the TAs and LAs for help/clarification there. The worksheets varied in difficulty, some weeks being more computational and others more conceptual, but honestly, that didn't matter because they were mostly graded on effort and completion anyways. This category was another easy 100% in my opinion, especially because the lowest 2 groupworks are dropped, so missing a week or two doesn't penalize you.
**
Homework was assigned weekly, came out of the textbook, and was honestly always a pretty short assignment. I don't think assignments ever exceeded 15 problems, and if you felt you wanted more practice, she included a list of suggested practice problems from the textbook every week to help reinforce the concepts. Personally, I liked this as you weren't forced to do excessive amounts of busywork. Homework was graded partially on completion and partially on correctness; a few problems were selected to be graded, and the remaining part of your grade was completion. If you paid attention in class homework assignments weren't typically difficult, and even on the more difficult problems, using your resources and reasoning through it with peers usually allowed you to figure out the right answers. The lowest two homework scores are also dropped.
**
All of the above items felt like good preparation for the exams, and additional resources were provided for those who felt they needed more. Before each exam, professor released a list of suggested practice problems from every section of the textbook that would appear on the exam, including some of the more conceptual true/false questions at the ends of the chapters. The LAs also provided review sessions before every exam, usually going over a shorter, more computational set of practice questions. Using these resources, it was always possible to prepare adequately and get a good score on the exams which fairly reflected the material we learned in class.
**
Overall this class was a great experience for me and I would definitely recommend taking Math 33A with Professor Rose Morris Wright if you are afforded the opportunity."
Rose Morris-Wright,Math 33A,Linear Algebra and Applications,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 22, 2020",A-,"She is one of the most caring professors at UCLA!! We need more professors like Rose, she is a literal goddess. I am a math major and although this class has been my least favorite so far, I still enjoyed it. There are some really interesting topics that could be applied to many fields. Rose drops about 30% of hw assignments, pre-class assignments, and group worksheets. She also has two grading schemes:Scheme 1 (Default)• Pre-Class Quizzes (15% of your grade)• Groupwork (10% of your grade)• Written Homework (10% of your grade)• Two midterm exams (each 20% of your grade)• Final exam (25% of your grade)
Scheme 2 (Drops the lowest midterm and scales everything else up accordingly)• Pre-Class Quizzes (18.75% of your grade)• Groupwork (12.5% of your grade)• Written Homework (12.5% of your grade)• Maximum of 2 midterm grades (25% of your grade)• Final exam (31.25% of your grade)
I would definitely recommend taking Math33A with Rose. Also reading the textbook is super helpful! Unfortunately, she does not curve at all because she does not like to cap grades and make grades a competition which I like cause, to be honest, it made me work a lot harder to receive a good grade in the class and it made me feel more proud that I received a good grade without curves."

All of the lectures were pre-recorded so you could watch them on your own time and they were super short, usually about 20-30 minutes. The actual scheduled time for lectures were just Q&As which was great because she cleared up any confusions.The tests were pretty easy, I would say even easier than the homework, and she didn't curve them because the class typically did really well.I highly recommend taking Morris-Wright!

CLASS FORMAT / TEACHING:
The class was a flipped classroom. We would watch short recorded lectures and complete an assignment before every live lecture. We were provided with many platforms in which we could ask questions or ask for clarification on a topic--the questions asked on CCLE would be answered during the live lecture by the professor, and questions on Campuswire would be answered by TAs. The flipped classroom format worked really well for me personally. While watching recorded and live lectures may seem like double the amount of work, it actually feels like the same amount because despite it being her first time teaching, Professor Rose's teaching style is super clear. If I was ever confused on a topic after watching the recorded lecture, then my confusion would almost always be resolved after she explains it during the live lecture. In addition, live lecture attendance was completely optional so you could just skip them if you want, although the live lectures proved to be extremely helpful most of the time.
ASSIGNMENTS
The pre-class assignments (completed before lecture) were always tricky. However, we were allowed many tries (sometimes infinite), so it's almost a guarantee that you will get full credit on them. Students often asked for clarification on the tricky questions, and the Professor would explain them during the live lecture. 
Weekly homework assignments also have a couple of tricky questions, but overall they're not too bad. The problems come from the textbook. You can find the solution manual online if you know where to look. 
During discussion sessions, we were put in small groups of 3-4 students which lasted the whole quarter. Every week we would be given a small group assignment that could be completed within the time allotted for the section. The questions there are a bit challenging since they are meant to be solved as a group. Doing the assignment somewhat helps in understanding the material, and it counts as participation credit.
EXAMS
There are two midterms and one final. All are half multiple choice and half written. The multiple-choice portion is exactly the same format as the pre-class assignments that I mentioned earlier, and the written portion is similar to the weekly homework problems. Questions are doable but definitely challenging. Exam averages always ranged between 85-93%, so they were never curved. The final exam felt noticeably longer than the two midterms.
HELPFULNESS
Not only is Professor Rose very helpful in answering questions during class and office hours, but she is also very considerate. She would provide accommodations for students who need them, and give extended due dates whenever CCLE randomly shut down. She also cares about fairness -- one time she found that some students had cheated on the two midterms and sent an 1800 word email explaining why that was wrong and how it is disrespectful to everyone involved. Of course, she didn't punish the whole class for the actions of the few.
TLDR: Professor Rose really cares about her students! The course material is definitely challenging, but the class isn't graded harshly. 10/10 would recommend others to take any class she teaches."

Rose Morris-Wright,Math 33A,Linear Algebra and Applications,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 20, 2020",A,"There are a lot of glowing reviews for Rose, and I completely understand where they are coming from. She has an amazing personality and clearly cares about her students. I have a slightly more critical opinion of her, however, and wanted to provide my own perspective so that you all get a more balanced perspective of what you're getting into when you sign up for one of her classes.I, personally, would much rather watch/attend lectures than read a textbook. Otherwise, I feel like I am simply paying $4.5k a quarter to take examinations. I was overall dissatisfied with the quality of Rose's lectures because they were extremely short and lacked depth. The majority of my learning, thus, came from self-teaching through trial and error on pre-class quizzes and homework assignments. I still pulled through with an A in the end, and I sincerely believe that I learned a lot, but I felt like I wasn't getting much value out of the portion of the class that I expect the most quality from (lectures).The lack of depth in lectures and the brevity of the homework assignments, in my view, made the examinations more confusing than they needed to be. The exams were heavy in theoretical True/False questions and soft proof exercises compared to the other math classes I've taken at UCLA, and I would not have felt adequately prepared for those questions if I had not completed the optional end-of-chapter True/False questions that the professor recommended a week before each exam. I hate it when students need to complete optional exercises to be adequately prepared for exams, and I felt like that was the case in this class.Overall, this was definitely the easiest math class that I've taken at UCLA. Low-stakes assignments and examinations made it an easy A. Note that this may just be due to the online format. If you are concerned about the depth of your learning, though, Rose may not be the best professor for you."

She genuinely cares about her students and their well-being, both in the class and outside of it. She offers multiple opportunities for extra credit or other means to raise your grade. She drops the lowest midterm grade, which saved my grade. I learned a lot from this class, but I would highly recommend reading the textbook along with watching lectures, as content from the textbook does pop up on exams and it's easy to get caught off guard. I would absolutely take her again."

The pre-class stuff was informative and you had 10 tries to complete it so it's very low stress. Exams were fair and Rose was always accessible. After an absolute nightmare experience online for 32B this class was honestly amazing. I would highly recommend Rose especially if you're still online. 10/10."
Rose Morris-Wright,Math 33A,Linear Algebra and Applications,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 23, 2020",A,"I will preface by saying Prof. Rose is most definitely an incredibly caring professor who wants her students to succeed and will always give them the benefit of the doubt *in regards to cheating. She is also nice and pretty organized however, I do not think she is the best professor for everyone.
She operates her class as a flipped classroom, where we watched 2 or 3 10-12 minute prerecorded videos before each class period and then we have pre-class assignments and questions after we videos we need answer as well. Her explanations are often short and don't do a good job at explaining the material throughly or concisely. I would often have to supplement my learning of the material with youtube videos. Because of this, her lectures are essentially glorified office hours that are often times not helpful. I stopped attending live lectures after the first few weeks because I was not getting any benefit from them. Since you don't know the order of the questions that will be answered, it is a waste of time to stay and watch the whole lecture if you do not understand one part of that day's lesson.
She also requires discussions to be mandatory because we have to complete a discussion worksheet with a group. Though it supplemented my learning, having mandatory discussions due to a worksheet that will just be graded on completion feels like a waste of time.
Side note, I always played her videos on 2x speed because she unfortunately does not have a very pleasant voice and I find that distracting.
Overall, the tests were relatively straight forward and very theory heavy (which she has said she does because of the online learning environment). I don't feel like she did a great job or preparing us for these exams. Her prerecorded videos are fairly surface level and also inadequately prepare us for the exams. I don't think her exams were difficult because we were able to use the internet and textbook. Prof. Rose is obviously incredibly caring and nice however she doesn't do a good job of explaining material coherently and for that reason if you're looking for an easy A you got it (assuming she teaches and grades relatively the same in person or next quarter) but don't expecting any sort of mastery from this class unless you supplement your learning with various other resources."

This was one of my last classes of the year after over a year of online courses and I was just too burnt out to enjoy the class.

His lectures were extremely clear. He provided detailed breakdowns for concepts and theories—allowing us to contextualise each of them with a relevant real-life application of them—and even blanked out certain key terms and sentences from the powerpoint PDF for lectures that he made available prior to classes to allow us to fill in the blanks as we went along. The concepts we learned were genuinely interesting and I’ve already found myself applying some of the topics related to bargaining and negotiation in daily life. We were assigned weekly, open-book quizzes once a week which very well-designed and easy. Discussions were enjoyable and gave us further opportunities to apply what we learned to real-life situations. The ‘final’ for this class is a 5-6 page long analysis paper on a significant world issue related to the concepts we studied. Last year, it was a paper on the Iranian nuclear issue and this year it was about the most effective ways for the U.S. to handle North Korea’s nuclear capabilities. The paper was not a cake-walk by any means, but if you have passable research skills and understood content well enough, you will do very well. I haven’t heard of anyone who got below a B+ on it.

The content of the class was also super interesting and we got to talk about a lot of issues that are especially relevant today. The grade consisted of participation in discussion sections (would highly recommend Carolyn as a TA, she was so great!!), weekly quizzes that were open note/open lecture/open book, and the final paper. Our final paper was about how to handle North Korea's nuclear stockpile which seemed very complex at first but you have almost the entire quarter to work on it and have it reviewed by your peers/TA so that was helpful. Also, you don't technically need the textbook for this class as Professor Min basically summarizes the chapters but if you are a person that likes reading the textbook you can find it online for free!

Professor Min is an amazing professor, is always helping, and just genuinely loves the content. The weekly quizzes were easy if you pay attention and take good notes, I got my first A+ in this class. I am not a Poli Sci major but the content is SO interesting I loved every single topic. The analysis paper is a huge part of your grade but it is honestly so easy if you pay attention in discussion and work on it over the weeks. Participation in discussion is a part of your grade and you actually have to contribute so pick a proper timing for your discussion section. There were no midterms or finals for this class this quarter. It was easy and the content was amazing, there is literally no reason why you shouldn't take it as a GE (or major requirement).
Dr. Min is the best professor I had so far at UCLA, he is so generous and lenient (records all classes) and his slides are always so organized and helpful. Do not hesitate to take this class. The topics covered are so interesting, from wars, to race and gender, to terrorism, to trade, and so many interesting and useful topics. Favourite class at UCLA so far and it was also easy!"
Eric Min,Pol Sci 20,World Politics,Winter 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 18, 2021",A,"BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS I'VE HAD AT UCLA! Professor Min was so so prepared every time he came to lecture. He uses slides and explains the material very clearly (so you really don't even have to read the textbook). Covid Edition classwork: weekly multiple-choice reading quizzes (but he covers everything so clearly in lecture so reading really isn't necessary), an analysis paper, and section participation. Pretty easy coursework and homework. ALSO Professor Min is so funny in lecture (he played nicki minaj & elevator music). He was definitely one of the clearest professors I've had. 1000/10 recommend <3"
Eric Min,Pol Sci 20,World Politics,Winter 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 16, 2021",A,Quizzes were straightforward and simple if you watched the lectures. The essay is quite difficult in my opinion since they basically ask a bunch of very young adults how to deal with one of the biggest problems in world politics. They probably grade easier than they could though. Lectures are incredibly engaging and interesting. One of the best classes I've taken at UCLA.

I highly recommend this class!!! also Julien is a great TA, and his office hours are pretty fun"

His lectures are always very structured and clear and his slides are very detailed. I can tell the attendance definitely went down over the quarter because it was easy to understand everything just from reading the slides, but he is a great lecturer who is very funny and witty. I enjoyed his lectures a lot. He is very encouraging to his students and was ready to help whenever possible. The class consists of 20% participation, midterm and final and a group project white paper. Participation was just showing up, the white paper was pretty easy too. I recommend bringing you a draft to the TA before turning it in and taking his advice will definitely secure you a high grade. The exams were pretty hard, the average was an 82% because it was very dense and reading-based. However, if you go to the lecture, you can definitely tell which concepts are more important and likely to be on the test and which are just unnecessary details. The readings were very dense and heavy and that's the only downside of this class. Professor Min is very helpful during his office hours too, he is very approachable and sincere. All in all, if you go to lecture, study the materials (make a quizlet), browse through the readings, you will get a good grade."

The grade is the midterm, final, an analysis paper, and section participation. I literally got like a 97 on the paper and I'm pretty sure most people got a high grade like that on the paper. Really great professor, very interesting lectures, it was my favorite class. You definitely do not need the book I didn't even open it and I passed with a B. The tests are not EASY, I'd get a B/C with hours of studying. The vocabulary in this class is very important so for tests really study the vocab words."
Eric Min,Pol Sci 20,World Politics,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 20, 2020",A,"Eric Min is a great professor and a funny, kind, interesting person. He puts real effort into making the class fun (including jokes and pop culture references). The class content itself is also pretty interesting. Your grade comes down to 3 things: the midterm, a 5-6 page analysis paper, and the final. The midterm is easy if you study his lecture slides (which he very plainly tells you to do). This makes the textbook completely unnecessary and not worth buying in my opinion. The analysis paper is done over the course of the first 8 weeks and peer-reviewed several times, meaning you should not stress over it. I don't consider myself a very good writer or very knowledgable in current events and the paper was still very doable. The final is the same format as the midterm (multiple choice and a few short answer) and again, if you study his lecture slides and listen when he tells you to pay extra attention to something, you'll be fine. Overall, this class was a great GE and easy enough in my opinion. Professor Min is truly a gem of a human being and I looked forward to his lectures. I would 100% take this class again & I would very highly recommend it."

Min is a very funny professor and gives really engaging lectures. I rented the textbook because I thought it was essential to read it but stopped around the 4th week or so and honestly don't get the book. It does highlight some material we cover in class more in depth but as long as you go lecture and grasp the material you should be fine. He blanks out some notes from the slides he posts online to motivate students to go to class to see the blanked out parts but honestly lecture wasn't that bad.

Class covers easy concepts and professor does an adequate job of explaining. He's chill and patient during office hours and seems to genuinely love teaching. There is one research paper, and that is the only assignment for the entire class.
Don't purchase the textbook, it's genuinely useless. Exams are based solely on slides, and they're thorough enough to go off of. Lecture attendance isn't mandatory, and concepts are easy enough to understand on your own. However, if you're having trouble, lecture is genuinely useful and sometimes fun to attend."
Eric Min,Pol Sci 20,World Politics,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 1, 2020",A,"Professor Min is one of the best professors I have ever had at UCLA. He is funny, engaging, and knows the material very well. He often makes jokes in class, making his lectures very enjoyable. I went to his office hours once after the midterm, and he was extremely helpful. He spent at least twenty minutes going over every single question I got wrong, and I learned a lot. 
Overall, PS 20 with Professor Min was a pretty great class. The workload wasn't too bad, since the readings aren't really required. There was one midterm, one paper, and the final. Professor Min posts his slides on CCLE and they basically cover everything in the reading, so study those and you'll be fine. Word of advice: start the paper early, you'll have a much easier time if you do so. 
Professor Min was an awesome professor and I'd definitely recommend taking his class!"
Eric Min,Pol Sci 20,World Politics,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Jan. 6, 2020",A,"You don't need to spend the $140+ on the textbook for the class as long as you go to the lectures, since all of the content for the midterm and final are in the lecture slides (which are also posted to CCLE). Professor Min emphasizes what you definitely need to know for the tests, and he gives real-world examples that clarify the theoretical concepts being covered in lecture. 
There is one research paper due towards the end of the quarter, but they really break it down over the course of the quarter and have you peer review each other's work throughout the process. You may want to go to office hours or email Professor Min or your TA to have a full understanding of what they're looking for (some of the instructions and the rubric can be a bit ambiguous), but otherwise it's a straightforward assignment.
Speaking of TAs, Yana Otlan is a helpful TA who genuinely cares about the subject and the students she's in charge of, and she seems to have the clearest understanding of diplomacy and war, so I highly recommend signing up for her discussion section."

Professor Min is funny, clear, and engaging. His slides are extremely well-organized and he provides them to students with blanks, which makes it easy to study for exams (although you will have to study for them). I read the textbook religiously at the beginning of the year, but I found myself getting the same grades when I just studied the content from the slides so I would recommend using the textbook as more of a reference for when you get confused. The structure of this class was perfect though and I would recommend it to anyone. My one complaint would be that the discussions were pretty pointless, but that didn't bother me that much in the grand scheme of things."
Eric Min,Pol Sci 20,World Politics,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 24, 2019",A,"I took this class my first quarter of college, but I can't imagine a professor being much better than this. His lectures are very organized, and he makes relatively boring topics engaging and interesting. You don't need the textbooks since his lectures are plenty enough for the exams. He doesn't have clicker questions, but he leaves parts of the slides blank online to encourage you to come to lecture. I found the discussions pretty useless. The quarter analysis paper was only 5-6 pages, required relatively little time, and was graded pretty easily. Instructions on it are a little confusing so I recommend going to office hours to clear that up before you start. As long as you look through his slides the midterm and final are both pretty easy. If the class A rate is less than 35% he gives everyone extra credit until it is at least 35%."

The workload is pretty light (one paper, a midterm, and a final); I generally didn't do the readings because the lectures cover the exact same topics. He does go through a LOT of info in lecture, so you might have to go back and fill in some notes after. Overall, I really liked this class and Professor Min; also want to give a huge shoutout to whoever airdropped me a pdf of the textbook during the first lecture."
Eric Min,Pol Sci 20,World Politics,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 22, 2019",A+,"I took this fall quarter of my freshman year and I thought that it was completely doable. Class consists of a midterm, a ""research"" paper, and a final. Discussion is mandatory. The final and the midterm are pretty easy if you just go over the slides. No need to really go to class because he puts the lecture slides online (but he does black out some key words so you'll need to get those from a friend). Overall, take the class for an easy GPA bump. I didn't put in a ton of effort and did well. For the paper, it's a pretty open ended questions that's easy to answer. Also, they really hold your hand through the writing process. You have to submit a proposal one week, then a two page outline a few weeks later, then a rough draft later, and then finally the final draft during week 9. It's literally impossible to fall behind because they guide you through it. Min is an engaging lecturer, though can get boring during lame material.

Some advice: Be wary of the wording on examinations. I've noticed that he creates some questions in such a way that glossing over even a single word could completely change the question's meaning. Make sure to take your time and read each question multiple times."
Eric Min,Pol Sci 20,World Politics,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 19, 2019",A,"First things first, DO NOT LET ANYONE SCAM YOU INTO BUYING A PDF OF THE TEXTBOOK FROM THEM. The textbook's not really necessary for the class, it's really more of a supplement with extra details.
Now onto the class itself, the grading is pretty straightforward, 15% participation (going to section is mandatory, lecture isn't), 20% midterm, 5% 1-page paper proposal, 25% 5 to 6-page paper, 35% final. It's definitely important to do well on the paper (going to office hours is super helpful!!!). The midterm and final do cover a lot of concepts that take a lot of memorization. I found that the hard part was more the amount of content that had to be memorized, not the difficulty of the concepts themselves, they were pretty straightforward. You do get practice midterms/finals in discussion, but keep in mind the actual exams were a bit harder than the practice ones. Professor Min does hold a review session for the final that's pretty helpful in consolidating all the information you should know for the exam.
Professor Min's an awesome lecturer, he's super clear, engaging, funny. Definitely pay attention in lecture, he drops LOTS of hints on what's going to be on the exam, like quite literally he constantly repeats, ""KNOW THIS FOR THE EXAM."" So even though lecture isn't mandatory, I'd recommend going because he explains stuff super clearly and makes concepts easy to digest. He also uses a lot of modern examples to explain certain concepts. I guess you could say he's ""hip with the kids."" He also posts the slides on CCLE with certain sections blanked out to motivate you to go to lecture, but if you want to refer them afterwards, just highlight the blanks and copy and paste it and the blocked out words should show up.
Overall, great class, 10/10 would recommend."

He's by far the most straightforward and reasonable professor I've ever had. He expects you to get your work done and participate (discussions are very mandatory) but he only requires what he believes you ought to do to understand the class concepts. There's only a midterm, final, and one paper (along with proposal, outline, etc.) but just review the slides and you will be absolutely fine. Textbook is a decent supplement but you don't really need it--download for free if you want but definitely don't spend the money to get a hard copy. Lectures aren't mandatory since all the slides are posted on CCLE although they do have blanks you need to be in lecture to fill out (tbh just highlight the blank, sometimes it shows up), HOWEVER, he's such an engaging, smart, and funny guy that it's worth your time to show up. He once read the entirety of the Cardi B-Nicki Minaj feud post (profanity included) to demonstrate a concept. At his very last lecture, the whole class applauded, which hasn't happened in any of my other classes, which just goes to show what a swell dude he is. 100% would take this class again."

If you read the textbook, and then use the slides in addition to the readings, you will do well in the class. Lectures are very straightforward, and he seems a fair guy and is young (cogent, does not ramble unnecessarily). The midterm practice exam he gives is much easier than the actual midterm, so be aware. The midterm consists of multiple choice as well as short answer questions.

The vague wordings on his tests feels like an AP World History exam. Your TA makes or break your grade. My TA wasn't helpful at all and seemed cold at times. You have to go with your TA even if it opposes what the professor says in class. Discussions are mandatory though. He blanks out slides, but classes are not to mandatory.

Vinay Lal,Hist 9A,Introduction to Asian Civilizations: History of India,Fall 2017,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Jan. 2, 2018",A,"tl;dr: not an easy A, but not difficult either. Attend lecture and you'll be fine.
Full Disclosure: I'm from India, so I learnt Indian history in high school. Having said that, I found this class really interesting. 
The final grade was 20% participation in the discussion section, 30% from the take home midterm exam and 50% from the final. 
Some of the other reviews of this course seem to complain about the reading workload (~150 pages per week), but you don't really need to do the reading. I personally found that attending class was far more rewarding. He tells you the stuff that is important/ unimportant, and if you pay enough attention, you can easily predict the questions that will come on the exams. 
Professor Lal's lecturing style itself is quite engaging, but he gets distracted a lot and tends to go off on tangents quite often. Also, he sometimes doesn't explain certain terms that people who aren't Indian may not intuitively understand. He also liberally mixes in his opinions with facts. 
We had a take-home midterm over the weekend in week 6, 2 essays, each 2-3 pages double spaced. The exam itself wasn't difficult, and he asked the most obvious questions in it. It's important to cite the reading material (he scans it to the class website) if you want an A instead of a B. About a week before the midterm, he went over a ""hypothetical midterm question"", which was on the actual midterm, so once again, attend lecture. 
The final was answering 4 out of 9 essay questions. The questions on the final were NOT ID questions, since the material was so vast. Instead, the questions were about the major themes he covered in the course. In section, the wonderful TA Vipin literally listed out 5 major themes that he thought were important, and all 5 were on the final. 
Professor Lal himself is a cool guy, and some of his ideas are pretty radical. As a Professor, he was very kind and even offered to have lunch with us after class one day. He has office hours twice a week and lets you pick his brain. 
This isn't really a throwaway easy GE, but if you attend lecture and put in a weekend of effort for the midterm and a few more days of studying for the final, you'll get that A pretty easily."

He also fails to elaborate on or define many Indian terms which makes the lectures that much more difficult to understand if you don't have previous knowledge of Hindi or the course material. It's just so much material to learn in such a short time that it gets really overwhelming. There also aren't very many dates or times which makes a lot of what you learn seem very circumstantial. Ultimately, it's an interesting course however there is just too much you are expected to know that isn't explained well enough. Also, Dan Newman as a ta is absolutely no help."

That is, he doesn't care much about the tiny details as long as you understand the forces behind what happened. Sometimes, he gives an inside joke (if you understand his language, you're on the inside) that makes you feel kind of like an outsider, but they are kinda funny jokes once you find out what they mean (like how we've all probably heard of desi in some other form already.. haha).  Anyway, good teacher, not afraid to talk about what he thinks, and he won't bore you with too many tiny details of unimportance. He's also a really easy grader.

Vinay Lal,Hist 9A,Introduction to Asian Civilizations: History of India,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 30, 2004",N/A,"Professor Lal is a great professor. He is definitely an expert. But you better have a lot of interest in Indian history if you take this class. Teaching 5000 years of Indian history in 10 weeks is crazy and so much reading is way too much for a GE class. Besides, the discussion of that class is ABSOLUTELY boring and super-long."
Laura Cladek,Math 33A,Linear Algebra and Applications,Winter 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 1, 2021",A,"For this class, the workload is relatively light (homework with answers you can find online), while the test includes great proportion of proof. To get through with the exam, the previous quarter midterms and answer keys posted by professor Cladek are VERY VERY HELPFUL. Questions on practice/previous exams are very similar to the actual ones, so make sure you go over those in advance. The best part is the notes. Professor will post notes of hers on CCLE so you dont even need to go to the lecture, just like me. I didn't go to the lecture even once this quarter. Grading break downs:Homework (30%), Quizzes (10%), Midterm 1 (15%), Midterm 2 (15%), Final (30%). The quiz is graded based on completion, but will contribute to extra credit as well, first attempt score>80 is a 1% bonus of final grade, and >90 is a 2% bonus, which maximumly can raise your grade by 3% overall. Generally speaking, this class for me is not that tough but not that easy because exams include lots of proof questions, but professor's materials can somehow help you get through her class, so that should be fine, relatively an easy A course."

People were saying she teaches out of the book, I think that is just because the material for this class was pretty easy- so there was not much more she needed to add. Any important topic was explained really well, and tests were very fair in my opinion. She was really nice & accommodating due to covid-19. She released practice tests that were super similar to the actual midterms, and gave us a 3 hr midterm and 48 hr final! The average for the second midterm was an A and she even curved up at the end of the quarter. There were quizzes every week that were sometimes hard, but they were multiple choice & she still curved them. I learned so much during this class, and really was one of my favorites math classes I have taken. I highly recommend this class and Professor Cladek!!"

TBHHHHH Cladek just isn't a very good lecturer. She confuses herself while she's talking and ends up saying things that aren't actually correct. Alot of the lecture she spends doing proofs that don't really matter and then she just barely has time to go over/explain very important concepts and terms, and she also doesn't give very many example problems in class. Her lecture notes are pretty good (although idk if they were just provided this quarter because it's online), so I recommend trying to learn mostly through the lecture notes/textbook. The exams and homework weren't very hard, so it's not too difficult to get a good grade, but I'd recommend taking 33A with a different teacher to get a better understanding of the material, especially since alot of the concepts taught in this class are extremely important in later math classes."

Laura Cladek,Math 33A,Linear Algebra and Applications,Winter 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 30, 2021",A,"The grading scheme for this class is: Homework (30%), Quizzes (10%), Midterm 1 (15%), Midterm 2 (15%), Final (30%). The quizzes are just completion based and there's opportunity for up to 3 percentage points of EC. So it's fairly generous in that regard.
The tests are fairly easy - and this is coming from a non-math major who really hates math here at UCLA. The midterms were about 75% computation based and 25% conceptual, which made them pretty easy even if you didn't understand much in class. The final, on the other hand, was heavily conceptual/definitional based but Cladek's notes/lectures do tell you everything you need to succeed in this class. 
Cladek herself isn't the greatest professor, so if you truly want to grasp the beauty of Linear Algebra probably look elsewhere, but if you're going for the grade, then the tests are definitely a pro of this class (at least in remote learning.)"
Laura Cladek,Math 33A,Linear Algebra and Applications,Spring 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 17, 2020",NR,"I would only take Laura's 33A class if there was no better option available for the quarter. She tends to teach straight out of the textbook (I've noticed the examples she does during lectures are identical to the ones in the textbook). Her lectures are okay, although her teaching varied greatly in quality. Sometimes she would be okay in explaining concepts, and other times I'd have absolutely no idea what was going on and I would finish watching the lecture confused. I ended up attending discussions with a TA from a different professor's class to try understand the content. She's also not that great at answering questions or clarifying concepts, and just repeats what she said earlier. She also focuses wayyy too much on proofs rather than the actual concepts. This led to me having a very patchy understanding of linear algebra and it was hard to see the significance of each concept that was taught. 
--She had weekly quizzes as well which also varied in difficulty from relatively easy to very very hard. They focused solely on conceptual understanding so I'd recommend doing the week's homework before the quiz.
--The homework was straight out of the textbook and half of it tended to be easy computational questions. However, the last few questions she chose were usually quite tedious and proof-based (some of which was never covered in class). The midterms were okay, but in true Cladek-style, they had proof questions too which weren't fun at all. The final was the worst, however. We were given 48 hours for it and a lot of the questions were very time-consuming and there were several proof questions too. I could not have done it in a normal 3 hour exam.
--However, she did have a very generous curve for the quarter (40% A's) although this was probably due to the fact we were all taking the class online during a pandemic. She does also curve up things like quizzes a lot (i.e. scales up an 80% in a quiz to a 90%) and homework is generally free marks, although the graders can be pretty nitpicky (they are also nitpicky in exams).
--Take Cladek's 33A if you want a relatively easy A with a generous curve. But if you want a solid understanding of linear algebra and don't want to be stuck doing random and useless proofs, take another professor if a better option is available.
--*DISCLAIMER - I took this class while everything was online during the COVID-19 pandemic so I can't speak of what Laura would be like in a normal quarter, but I'd imagine it'd be more or less the same*"

Laura Cladek,Math 33A,Linear Algebra and Applications,Spring 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted July 3, 2020",A,"I feel like keeping this brief so (keep in mind that this was online and was her first lecture ever, I think):- as others have said, not very clear. When you ask questions, she kind of repeats statements she's said. Linear algebra is based in a lot of definitions that build on top of each other, those of which she will define one time and expect you to know it every single time after. She seemed kind of flustered when teaching. - I was doing pretty badly in the class by the first midterm. Then, I stopped going to lecture entirely and, based on the syllabus, read from the textbook. I started getting As on everything after that.- The practice midterms and finals were really close to the midterms especially. the final was a bit more proof-based which I hadn't practiced and thus took a long time. Nevertheless, it was similar enough to the homework, which she says.- Quizzes are really conceptual and kind of vague, but it has a really beneficial grading scheme (a 70% translates, on average, to 85% or up).Not a wonderful professor, but altogether a nice person. Very willing to receive feedback, so hopefully she gets better in the future."
Laura Cladek,Math 33A,Linear Algebra and Applications,Spring 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 24, 2020",A,"First and foremost, Cladek is not a very good lecturer. There were times where I wondered why I even bothered showing up to class in the first place. She would spend most of the class doing proofs and not really explaining anything beyond that. I had to go to the book after class to even try to understand what she was doing and even then it made little sense.That being said, the grading in this class is very nice. Homework was 30%, weekly quizzes were 15%, both of the midterms were 15% each, and the final was 25%.The homework in this class was pretty easy to get full points on but there were usually a few questions at the end of sections that would take a while to do. Lowest homework grade was dropped as well.The midterms were both fairly straightforward and getting a good grade on them wasn't too difficult as long as you knew what you were doing.The weekly quizzes are probably my biggest gripe with this class as I just don't like weekly quizzes in general. These were one of two things: very hard or very easy. Most were the former. However, the quizzes are curved very nicely and so you could usually end up with a good grade on them. Lowest quiz was also dropped as well.The final wasn't too bad. It was definitely harder than the midterms and I feel that it was longer than a normal 3 hour final (simply because the questions were long, though, not because it was hard).However, we had 48 hours to do it so this wasn't a problem. And, much like the midterms, it didn't seem too difficult to get a good grade on it.Overall, I wouldn't suggest taking Cladek unless you absolutely have to or you really want a fairly easy A. If you want to really learn the material, however, I would suggest taking the class with another professor."

She had her notes pre-written and during the lectures she would basically just talk through them at a very fast speed. I have a feeling that when she asked if there were any questions and didn't get a response it was because we didn't have enough time to process what was going on to even ask a question, or at least that's how I felt. If her style of teaching is similar in the future, you may find it better to look at the notes beforehand or read through the textbook beforehand too because learning everything from her lectures is really hard.

I stopped attending Cladek’s Zoom lectures week 3 because she focuses way too much on proofs, and when she does pause for questions, her explanations lack clarity and imo consulting the textbook would be much quicker/helpful.
The homework was fine, some questions were more time-consuming than most. As other people have mentioned, quizzes often covered conceptual ideas but she curved generously.

The subject material, mind you, is not easy, but she is very good at explaining complex concepts in an understandable way. Naturally, it may take some time to wrap your head around these concepts, since it is linear algebra, but she does all that a professor can to help you understand. She also takes a lot of time to answer questions in class, so that is definitely really helpful. Also, her lectures were pretty easy to pay attention to/engaging, which is neat.~The exams are fair. The homework is fair and mostly helpful, she's also really helpful and approachable in office hours.~Professor Cladek is a really, really nice person. She definitely cares a lot about student learning. I would highly recommend taking 33a with her, since I'm not sure if you'll find another equally good 33a professor.~Also, one time, she had The Man.

Not a bad professor, but not the best you could find.

Her weekly, conceptual quizzes are decently hard but she curves them, and her midterms(2)/final is straightforward as long as you studied and paid attention throughout the year."

I do not doubt that Prof. Cladek understands the material, but her lectures are poorly organized and ultimately difficult to follow given her frequent computational errors, many of which she doesn't catch until hours later and attempts to correct through long, rambling emails. To succeed in this class, I would honestly recommend skipping lecture entirely (you'll just get confused) and reading the textbook sections covered very thoroughly. In terms of graded material, the homework problems are typically pretty straightforward and include proofs that further your understanding of important topics, while the short weekly quizzes tend to be more difficult but are usually curved heavily. Despite her many shortcomings, I would ultimately recommend taking this class with Prof. Cladek because she writes some of the most reasonable midterms and final exams I have seen in college thus far; in fact, some problems taken directly from the practice problems she will give you the week before."
Laura Cladek,Math 33A,Linear Algebra and Applications,Spring 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 23, 2020",A,"I TOOK THIS CLASS DURING COVID SO THINGS ARE PROBABLY DIFFERENT IN PERSON. 
Honestly, she isn't a great lecturer. She doesn't really answer questions if you ask in lecture and kind of repeats the same statements over and over again. Her worked examples helped me a little but generally I didn't learn a lot from lectures. The homework really helped me learn because I would just self teach using the textbook to apply the workings. Cladek also had quizzes every week - she curved each quiz depending on difficulty and the lowest was dropped. Some of the quizzes were straightforward and understanding based while others, I found to be extremely difficult. Her quizzes were very different to the other math class quizzes I'd taken because they are EXTREMELY conceptual, its almost always linked to theorems or proofs rather than applications, which is what I was used to. Finally, he exams were at a fair level of difficulty, they were very similar to practice exams for me with a few trickier questions thrown in to balance it out. Often the exams have proofs which are marked pretty closely. 
She is a professor that is accommodating but if you are not very good at self-teaching or prefer listening to lectures to really learn I wouldn't recommend taking her class. However, if you are just looking for an average difficulty class and are decent and self-teaching then she isn't a bad choice."

Professor cha is a really good lecturer and always willing to reteach topics and answer questions during the lecture. I took this during covid so the recordings are recorded and uploaded right after lecture. You do have to attend lecture cuz participation is worth 20% but if you can't attend lectures live she gives you other ways to participate. Participation in live lectures is just answering poll questions and you don't need to get them right lol and you're also allowed to miss lecture 2 times. As far as exams go, there's two of them and each is worth 20%. The exams are basically 2 midterms one in week 4 and one in week 10. The second one isn't cumulative so that was nice, you just had to know stuff after the first midterm for the second one. However, the second one is definitely harder than the first one since the material on the first midterm is pretty easy. The other 20% are weekly quizzes that are open notes and untimed, she drops the two lowest ones. Those are also really easy so another free 20% lol. Lastly 20% is for the lab assignments where you basically just copy the code the TA gives you so yeah another free 20%, she also drops the lowest lab. Oh yeah, to ease stress level due to the pandemic she offered 2% extra credit for just filling out her personal evaluation form so honestly this class is literally a free A and 10/10 recommend it."

Professor Cha is amazing and a solid choice for Stats 10. In the first lecture, she was very kind and made it clear she cared about our physical and mental health, and she said to talk to her if we had any such issues. As you can see from the grading scheme, she drops the lowest scores in most of the categories. Her lectures are very clear and she does a lot of examples to make sure you understand the concepts. The last unit on Hypothesis Testing is a bit harder to get, but with enough practice you’ll get used to it. I’m a freshman who’d never taken a stats class before and found this class very easy to follow, and if you’ve taken AP Stats it’ll probably be even easier. This quarter for online learning she did half synchronous lectures (on Tuesdays) and half asynchronous lectures (on Thursdays). I liked this format as it allowed for some flexibility for the Thursday lessons and also made it so we weren’t doing the same thing over and over for every lesson each week.
Participation in synchronous lectures was easy, you just had to answer poll questions she presented during class and you didn’t even have to get the answer right. With the asynchronous lectures, you had to answer questions intermittently throughout the lesson on CCLE, and these also felt pretty easy to me. Quizzes were untimed, multiple choice, and fairly similar to her examples from the lecture. Labs were easy as long as you followed along with your TA as they coded in R to answer the questions. The exams were completely multiple choice, 30 questions long, non-cumulative, and reasonable to complete within the time limit. The project was a new assignment she was trying for this quarter and it took a bit of effort, but since you were allowed to work in groups of up to 5, it was easy enough to spread out the work. If she keeps doing the project in future quarters, make sure you pay attention to labs/rewatch the recordings of labs/save your code from labs as you do have to use R on the project. Even if you weren’t an expert programmer, it was fairly simple to figure out what code to use in my opinion, as you could reference your labs and easily figure it out from there.
Overall I found this class to be fairly easy, and Professor Cha to be an excellent teacher. Whether you need to fulfill a science GE, need a basic stats class for your major reqs, need a stats class for your minor reqs, or simply want to learn the basics of statistics, I highly recommend this class."

The Thursday asynchronous lectures were all relatively interactive and well laid out so they really helped digest the material. The labs were relatively easy as you could often just finish them during discussion sessions or watch the recordings afterward. The weekly quizzes were also relatively easy and good at keeping the material fresh in your head as even though you only could submit once, you had all weekend to do it. The exams were during Week 5 and 10 and were not cumulative and relatively easy with each only being worth 15%. The final project is designed for one person but you can work on it with a group of up to 5 people which made it take no time at all.

Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Winter 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 14, 2021",A,Professor Cha is amazing- her lectures are so clear and she always makes sure everyone understands the material. Discussion sections are dedicated to weekly labs and I spent no extra time outside of the discussion section working on the labs. Would love to take another class with Professor Cha.
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Summer 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 5, 2021",,Prof. Cha was so accomodating during COVID in the summer! I decided to take this course last minute and the workload was very manageable. I felt like I learned a lot if the course that helped me in a lot of other classes. She made learning stats super easy to comprehend and I would HIGHLY recommend taking the course with her!!

If you have a choice I would definitely recommend going with Professor Cha."
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 24, 2020",A,"Dr Cha is a great lecturer and the material of this course is very easy. I highly recommend this class for people looking for a science GE that doesn't use too much memorisation or difficult math. All important formulas are given, and Dr Cha gives a lot of preparation material for exams and quizzes. 
The lectures are recorded, and asynchronous students simply need to answer 5-10 questions based on the recording of the lecture which is usually covered in the video anyway.
The only difficulty I faced in this class was the labs in R. TA sessions walk through them question by question, so you usually will get full marks for it, but I felt that there were certain things I didn't really understand but just copied from the TA."
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 19, 2020",A+,"This class was fairly easy for me, as I had taken AP Statistics in high school. As the other reviewers mentioned, Professor Cha is extremely helpful during the online synchronous lectures, and her lecture slides provide clear examples of key statistical concepts. In lecture, she often emphasizes or repeats certain topics that are going to be tested on the quizzes and exams. Her exam questions are very fair and are almost always based off her lecture slides. 
The grading breakdown for this course is:20 % lecture participation (can miss up to two lectures)20% online quizzes on CCLE (lowest two scores are dropped)20% lab (lowest lab score is dropped)20% exam 1 (taken week 4)20% exam 2 (taken week 10)
In terms of difficulty, the course starts off pretty easy, but gets harder around week 7 when it covers statistical inference. Exam 2 is significantly more difficult than exam 1 since it covers harder topics, but I will say my previous background with statistics definitely helped me through the later parts of the course. The labs are not too difficult to complete since you get a ton of guidance from your section TA (including some R code).
I took this class as a GE and am very satisfied about this professor and course. Overall, definitely would recommend even for those in non-STEM majors. Note that I haven't actually received my final grade yet, so the grade I entered for this review is my predicted grade (based on my assignment scores)."
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Fall 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 18, 2020",A,"Stats 10 was pretty much what I expected. Professor Cha is SUPER sweet and clearly cares about the learning of her students and making sure people understand concepts before moving on, which I really appreciated. She is very conscious of monitoring the chat and making sure to answer questions as they come in and engage students through examples and poll questions as much as possible. You do have to go to the lectures which I was not crazy about, but the way you get participation is through poll questions during lecture. There were a few days where she posted interactive lectures on CCLE instead of live, which I thought was a nice break in the quarter. In terms of tests, if you pay attention, go over her slides (especially the example problems) and do her practice tests, you will be totally fine. I cannot emphasize enough how fine you should be - and she gave extra credit after the final that was worth two entire test questions (and there were only 33 total so that was pretty amazing). Before taking this class a bunch of people warned me that it is deceptively easy until the midterm and then ramps up super fast... I think you can get away with half-assing this class before the midterm 100%, but after the midterm just be aware it does get a little more conceptually difficult and it's worth it to pay more attention and engage a little more otherwise you might have to cram a little more for the final. Section is super simple, don't have to go in person, TAs guide you through the labs really well and make R seem super simple. Very easy to get a good section grade as long as you watch the videos at some point and put some effort in. Overall, I had to take this as a requirement and I had a really good experience."

The material covered in this class is very closely related to any stats material covered in high school, an overall great introduction to stats. The professors presentations were very helpful as they covered all of the necessary material. Also, the tests were fairly straightforward, relating homework material with class material. I would definitely recommend this class to another student as it was an easy class for me over the summer."
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Summer 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Aug. 3, 2020",A+,"This was the first class I took at UCLA and it was a great one to start with! Even though we only had one live session, I can tell that Prof Cha is nice. The grading is fairy lenient:20% lab (3 labs, basically follow along with the TA as they teach you how to code with R)20% check-ups (8 check-ups, and they're CCLE questionnaires taken for a participation grade)20% quizzes (4 quizzes, lowest score is dropped)20% Exam 120% Exam 2There are some textbooks recommended for the class, but I purchased neither of them and I was fine. But, if you feel you need extra practice, you should probably purchase.Exams slightly mirror the practice exams (which Prof Cha provides). The concepts are the same on each, but the questions aren't necessarily the same type. You can succeed on the exams by taking the practice exams then going back and correcting your mistakes just to make sure you have a solid understanding of everything.The class overall wasn't too difficult, but that's probably because a lot of the concepts had already been introduced to me in AP Bio and AP Psych. I probably put in around 5 hours of work for each ""class"" day (more like recorded lecture day lol. It breaks down into 2 hrs of lecture + 1 hr of TA + 2 hrs of condensing the slides into my own notes). I think this time commitment is reasonable for a time-crunched summer session.Overall, just put in the work and you will get the results!"
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 13, 2020",B,Cha is a good lecturer. The material in my opinion is confusing but if you're good with formulas this class will be fine. If you're not you might struggle because her tests are pretty hard. She is helpful in office hours and she gives you a practice exam and cheat sheet during the exam.
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 1, 2020",B+,pretty easy class. you literally just have to show up and do all the work she assigns. no extra studying because you get a cheat sheet for every exam. got a B+ because i’m dumb
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 28, 2020",A+,"Great class, was kind of a shock as to how easy it was because all of my other classes have required so much studying and work on a daily basis and this one just required some revision before exams and a R studio lab every other week. Definitely lightest, easiest course I have taken so far. The exams were pretty decent plus you got a cheat sheet for them, still recommend going through all the slides and practice problems on slides though. I did not use the textbook once but did study a lot through khan academy stats just for practice. She gave participation points with clickers and was a great lecturer. The labs would have been hard to complete on your own I think but luckily I had a great TA (Sun, Y.) who literally did it step by step for us haha, so it was very simple."
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 28, 2020",A,"Loved Professor Cha. She's really kind and truly cares about student learning. In addition, she had a really calm presence in class that kind of made this class almost feel like therapy after a busy day. Attendance is required (iclickers) but honestly it's better to go anyway because its much easier to learn all the material in class with an actual lecturer as opposed to spending maybe 2 hours self teaching the concepts the night before the exam. Anyway, the class is really easy. There are weekly labs but the TAs pretty much provide the code so all you have to do is attend discussion. The weekly quizzes are really easy as well and are good practice for the midterms. Her exams are nice, they're all multiple choice and don't necessarily have any curveballs. Overall, Stats 10 is a super easy class. If you've taken AP Stats then thats great; if you haven't it's still super super easy. You might have to pay a little more attention during the latter half of the class but the material is still really intuitive. Anyway, if you want to optimize this class as an easy GE, I recommend paying attention in lecture and going to discussion so you won't have to spend any time at all studying outside of class."
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 27, 2020",A+,"Maria Cha is the nicest professor I have ever had. The material is pretty easy and everything is on the slides. I feel like how well you do on the midterms is dependent on how well you've prepped your cheat sheets. There's no final which is really nice, so you can focus on other finals during finals week. The material on the second midterm is definitely harder than the first just because there's a lot more formulas and scenarios to keep track of, but as long as you pay attention to the lectures and write it all down on your cheat sheet for the midterm you will be completely fine. This was a really calm, relaxing GE to take during winter quarter."

Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Winter 2020,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 25, 2020",B,"Grade breakdown:Exams: 60% total, 30% eachOnline Quizzes: 20% total out of 8 quizzes (and then drop your lowest 2 scores)Participation: 4%, received by answering at least one clicker question during lectureLab: 16% total (4% each lab assignment) drop lowest score out of 5
The lab is absolutely nothing to worry about. In lab all you do is code in R (coding program). It's not hard at all though because the TA does all the work and all you have to do is copy it into your own laptop. I did work for other classes while my TA explained stuff and just looked up when she would scroll down so I could copy down more code. That being said, the lab didn't really have much to do with lecture. It used the same statistical concepts but you won't need to code for exams or anything on the concepts from class aren't really elaborated on, just shown with code. Pretty much a free 16%.
Quizzes aren't too bad either and you get to drop your lowest two scores. You have the weekend to do it on your own time online and so you can use your notes and everything. Good place to study from for the midterm and final.
I didn't really pay attention during lecture but still came out with a B so the class isn't all the bad, especially if you've taken AP Stats or something (unlike myself). Would recommend. Professor Cha is really nice.

Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 26, 2020",A,"If you took AP Stats, you're set for this class. If you didn't take AP Stats and stats is a completely new concept to you, you'll still be fine because Professor Cha does a really good job of explaining things. If you have any questions, she's very patient and puts a lot of effort into ensuring that you thoroughly understand whatever you're learning. She also posts lecture slides online, so you can always refer back to those too. You'll still have to attend lecture because of iClicker questions, but I usually just left class after the first iClicker question; you only need to answer once to get credit for the day. Stay for the entire lecture if you're learning something new though! I think it would be more useful to hear her teach instead of just reading off of the slides.Each week you get a quiz, and every two weeks you are assigned a lab. Both are easy. For the quiz, you can look at the slides if you need to. For the lab, you work on it in your discussion section with your TA; while discussions aren't mandatory, you should definitely attend if you're working on a lab that day. The labs are done through this confusing program called Fathom, and you'll need to see the TA do it to understand how to navigate the system. And besides, the TA will basically be giving you all the answers you need for the lab, so why not attend? The most important piece of advice I have for people taking this class is to KNOW WHAT YOUR CALCULATOR CAN DO. Since I took AP Stats in highschool, I knew all the shortcuts and functions my graphing calculator (TI-84) could perform and I didn't really need to use the formula sheet that Professor Cha gave. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the graphing calculator can literally cut your work time in half."
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Summer 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 9, 2020",A+,"If you took statistics in high school this is very similar to that, probably easier. Cha is a really good professor and the material isn't that hard to comprehend, as long as you just go over your notes and study for the midterm and final. Discussions aren't mandatory, but if you want help on the labs every week then take advantage of it. There are also quizzes every week but they're easy as long as you went to lecture or took notes from the textbook. The midterm was very easy and the final was pretty hard but there is a very generous curve. If you want something not that challenging and it's a prereq for your major, I highly recommend this class."
Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 7, 2020",A,"Professor Cha is very kind and helpful. She is a good lecturer, but the material can be kind of boring and slow, but that's just how it is. She gives a lot of chances for redemption. She drops the lowest lab grade, which you normally get full credit just for doing, she drops the two losest quiz grades, and she allows you to miss one day's worth of clicker points. Attendance is somewhat required but it only makes about 5% of the grade if I recall, so it's not a make it or break it. My only concern taking her class is that she doesn't curve the final grades unless the average is below 75% (which will not happen) and she does not give extra credit. That being said you have to be precise on the midterms to get a desirable grade. If you make small mistakes that add up, its kind of a ""tough luck"" situation."

Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 26, 2019",B+,"I was actually pretty shocked going into this class as to how inaccessible the content was for me. I had taken AP calculus in high school but never stats, so I was excited for this class because I thought I would do really good and learn something new. I actually wound up getting a C+ on the midterm to my surprise because I really thought I understood the concepts. I guess the questions were just really tricky. The class does deal with such a wide range of content that I found it very hard to keep up. I also felt like I didn't have as many rights as a student because I didn't have time to go to office hours and find out what I did wrong, so I'll never know. Also, nobody really wanted to speak up in class because it's just such an awkward atmosphere with like 200 people in the room. This was by far my toughest class this quarter, and I guess it made me realize math just isn't for me. I bet a lot of math majors take this course and so they wind up doing well, but I thought I try my hand at it being an arts major, and I guess it was my mistake. It was too fast for me and there was just too much going on. Perhaps if there was less going on, then I would've done a lot better. I'm not sure how this really applies to anything I'm doing but I really tried in this course and that's more than most people can say. There are weekly quizzes which are simple and straightforward and the labs are pretty easy as well, just make sure you go to discussion. It's the two examinations that are tough since each is weighted 30% and there are only 29 questions which means you can't miss a lot. You do get a sheet of paper to write down the formulas but you also want to make sure you write the definitions of the concepts. The slides are pretty dense, so make sure you understand the content on their as best as you can. Another qualm I had with this class is that the professor's voice is pretty annoying. She can't help it, but to me it sounded like an alarm clock that would not stop. I felt bad for her because she must have vocal fry after speaking with that much inflection over time. Overall, this is doable if you are inclined to pursue STEM. It just wasn't for an arts major like me."

Cha is an extraordinarily nice person however and really takes great care to always stop and see if there are any questions, and she will explain the material until she feels that everyone knows what is going on. There are biweekly labs due and weekly online quizzes, as well as clicker questions in class to check for participation.

If you've taken AP Stats (which I did before) then you should be fine if you brush up a little bit before exams. Also, knowing how to input everything into the calculator is pretty helpful because most of the time if you enter things wrong into the calculator you won't get an answer on the test because it's multiple choice and assumes you will make your mistakes doing it by hand.

In terms of content, I spent a few hours with Khan Academy which was helpful to supplement. Lectures can be a little dry, but the slides are posted and easy to follow along, (especially w in class examples) and Cha is helpful during office hours if you show up.Textbook is not necessary unless you want extra problems.

Maria Cha,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 26, 2019",A+,"I took AP Stats in high school but took this class for GE and found it to be very easy. The grading is:
4% participation- with iClicker; as long as you answer at least one question during each lecture (doesn't even have to be correct) then you're good, and you can miss up to one class. If you get Reef, you don't even have to go to lecture.
20% online quizzes- on CCLE, a few easy multiple choice questions assigned every Friday, due on Sunday. Drop lowest two scores as well
16% labs- There's 5 labs (about one due every two weeks), lowest grade is dropped. You'll have to get a $6 course reader from the campus bookstore. You can either go to your TA's lab session every week, or you can do it on your own time if you download the Fathom software (it costs $5 to rent for a year). As long as you read the instructions in the course reader/lab manual, you can fully complete the labs by yourself; they're very straightforward.
60% exams, 30% each- There's midterms weeks 5 and 10, and the material is not cumulative. They're 25-30 multiple choice and I aced both of them. She lets you bring a one-sided formula sheet as long as it's handwritten. Also, you can use any calculator you want. That means if you have a TI-84 and know how to use the DISTR and STAT menus, you barely have to do any work at all; you can have the calculator do the z- and t-tests or normal/binomial distribution stuff for you. If you got a 5 on AP Stats these should be a breeze.
Overall, during lecture she was pretty clear and she posted her lecture slides in advance every week. She 'recommends' you get the textbook ""Essential Statistics: Exploring the World Through Data, Second Edition"" by Gould, Ryan and Wong but it's not necessary at all; her slides cover everything and have plenty of examples."

Her lectures were incredibly dense and hard to understand. However, she did take our feedbacks half way into the quarter and slowed down + spelled out structures + added more diagrams. I would recommend taking really good notes because there's weekly quizzes. I also recommend focusing on the stuff in the lab manual when you study for her midterm/final. There is absolutely too much details in her notes to memorize for the test. Our exams were closed book and conducted over zoom with TAs monitoring us. I don't think she was the best professor and I definitely stressed about this class. However, her exam was definitely doable. The exams are for the most part NOT as detailed as her lecture, which is why I recommend studying off the lab manual. I never went to office hours, but I heard that its mostly Q+A style. Overall, this course had a very heavy workload. I spent 8-10 hours each week taking notes for her lecture, 3-5 hours in lab, and an additional 1 hour completing the lab manual/making edits after labs.

Highly recommend going to office hours and asking questions about what muscles are working with what types of movement, and going over general anatomy in the second half of the course. She gave us sheets on what muscles do what movement and you are expected to memorize and understand that for the practicals as well. For the first half of the course, you will be going over all the body systems, which in my opinion, was really difficult. Her tests are hard and I recommend studying in groups and explaining to someone the exact steps each system goes through, where they get their blood supply, etc. Overall, I really enjoyed Professor Khankan and good luck in the course!"

She does not try to trick you or confuse you. She is so helpful and open outside of class. The material it's hard alone, but Professor khankan does an amazing job making it more understandable. She does bring some concept questions but that's just to make you a better student in the subject. What I could recall from her midterms, it had MC , fill in the blank, and short response. You will have to put in some work and study because there is a lot of material. It's not easy but it's doable. And very interesting with a Dr. Khankan.Labs are fun too, real cadavers. I had a great TA , Gaby. I'm not sure if she'll TA for this lower div again but I know she TAs for other upper div physci classes and will suggest picking her.
Overall both these ladies know their stuff, are very sweet, very helpful. I would highly recommend them!"
Anthony R Friscia,Physci 13,Introduction to Human Anatomy,Winter 2021,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 30, 2021",A,"Doctor Friscia is a great lecturer, his exams are fair, and he cares about his students learning. This class has weekly quizzes, one midterm and a final (quizzes were super easy, midterm and final were doable and not tricky). For the lab portion, we had 2 presentations instead of practicals. I would recommend taking any classes with doctor Friscia, he is one of the best professors I ever had in undergrad."

This class was definitely tough, I STUDIED A LOT, but Dr. Friscia is a really good teacher. I found that I was super on top of studying for the midterm (like started studying about 2 weeks in advance) and then struggled a bit more with staying on top of it for the second half. I didn't need to end up taking the final but that was only because it became optional when classes shifted online due to covid-19. I found it helpful to see breakdowns so here were mine:Midterm: 94%Practical 1: 100%Practical 2: 93%Final: - didn't take-
The midterm and first practical are on the same day, which was really stressful but I genuinely think it helped because there was some lecture material on the practical. The final was a week after the second practical so I didn't review lectures to prepare for the second practical which made the exam a lot harder. Overall I really enjoyed this class and if you work hard it'll pay off! Also the LAs are amazing resources!"

The most challenging part of this class was identify the muscles and remembering the actions, origins, and insertions. Make sure to go to the lab before the practical to practice identifying each muscle and to examine the bones. Overall, I enjoyed this class and learned a lot. 
Would definitely recommend taking this class with Dr. Friscia."
Anthony R Friscia,Physci 13,Introduction to Human Anatomy,Winter 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 23, 2019",A,"Dr. Friscia is an amazing professor. He’s friendly and charming and truly cares about his students, but don’t underestimate the class by the reviews, it’s a lot of work! The first half of the class we learned development, connective tissue, bones, and muscles. While the last half of the class was composed of neuroanatomy, organs, epithelia, and pathways. You don’t have to read the book because he provides all the information you need on his slides. He reads off slides and Bruincasts his lectures, but I recommend attending class because he writes out charts and diagrams of the concepts which becomes helpful when reviewing the for the exams. In lab, you study models and human cadavers which was an awesome perk to taking anatomy at UCLA instead of at community college (I’m a transfer and anatomy at my cc had cat cadavers). Our Lab TA Trong, was nice and helpful. I would recommend going to lab office hours because just looking at the models during lab time is not enough time to study. I heard Dr. Friscia’s office hours were also helpful but I was never able to go. 
Here is information about the exams since I found the previous review very helpful when I took the class. 
Midterm Practical (20%): 102.5/115 (before recalculating grades 96.5/115)5 points extra credit were possible. There were around 30 stations and each station had 3-4 questions. The stations consisted of cadavers and bones with pins or stickers on them. This practical was difficult for me despite studying A LOT. Make sure you spell everything correct and you always include whether it’s the right or left side of the body or you will lose points. Also, know your insertion and origins of the muscles because some of the cadavers may be arranged in positions you haven’t seen before. Lastly, don’t doubt yourself! I did and ending up missing a lot of questions I knew. 
Midterm Written (30%): 87.5/100 (before recalculating grades 82.5/100)10 point extra credit were possible. He provided a study guide with 30 questions to help guide our studying. Some of the questions on the midterm were from the study guide. The midterm consisted of multiple choice, fill in the blank, free response, and true and false. He gives you 4-5 short answer questions and terms to define and lets you pick 2-3 of each that you want to answer. I studied tremendously for the exam but didn’t do as well as I wanted too. The exam was fair and most students did really well. 
Final Practical (15%): 99/100 4 points of extra credit were possible on this. This practical was harder than expected because he incorporated some lecture material which many students hadn’t started studying for yet. The practical was the same amount of stations but slightly fewer questions each. A lot of the questions were about neuroanatomy so make sure you know that well. The final practical was way easier than the midterm practical imo. 
Final Written (25%): 99.5/95The final was not too difficult, most of the questions were on the study guide he provided us about a week before the final. He gave us the full three hours to take the final, yet most finished within two hours. 13 points extra credit were possible, which helped my grade tremendously. 
Quizzes (10%): 78/80We had quizzes each week which through CCLE. He gave us two attempts and 25 mins for a ten question quiz. The quizzes are not the same with each attempt but they are not difficult if you study the lecture notes.
Final grade before he recalculate midterms: 92% A-Final grade after he recalculated midterm: 94% a solid A!!:)
As you can see he wants his students to succeed and I’m so grateful that he recalculates the midterm grades if you improve on the final. I was literally about to drop the class after midterms, but I talked myself out of it because dropping a class because I might get a B is pretty dumb and I’m so glad I didn’t drop! I read on a previous review before taking the class that says he recalculates grades if you perform better on the final, but he never mentioned it to our class. He’s seriously an angel. I would recommend him to anyone taking Physic 13<3"

Professor Friscia:Dr. Friscia is a great professor. Very charming and funny and also very clear on the material. Lectures are always engaging and he makes the material fun to learn. In lecture, he expands on the course material by using real world applications. Textbooks aren't required, but they can be helpful. Though I never used one. This class is not curved, but the instruction and the many extra credit opportunities in exams give you a great chance to do well in this course. He says that he teaches this class in a way so that you actually retain what you learn so that many who are in the class for grad school can take it all with them. I'd say he was pretty successful.
TA Ymi Ton:Labs were 3 hours twice a week, but sometimes it ended early. You need to buy the lab manual, which isn't too expensive - $13. Throughout lab you'll be filling in labels for diagrams of organs/muscles/etc. The beginning it basically filling out the lab manual and the end is actually going over what was covered with models/specimens. Any leftover time can be spent reviewing more, or you could go home. It's pretty cool to see the specimens! You have the opportunity to touch some of them as well. Ymi was a great TA in my opinion. She was very clear and labs were always organized.
Quizzes Grade: 70/708 quizzes were given on CCLE about once a week. The lowest grade is dropped. Each consists of 10 multiple choice questions. As long as you refer to your notes, you should get 100% every time. Sometimes questions from previous quizzes also pop up. He'll let you know which material each quiz will cover.
Written Exam 1 Grade: 104.75/105Written exams consist of every type of question - multiple choice, true/false, matching, short answer. They're only focused on things covered in lecture, so you don't need to worry about the more in depth stuff you learn in lab. The questions are pretty straightforward, so if you study it shouldn't be a problem. Shouldn't be a time crunch either. I did not get this high of a grade when I initially took it. He has this formula to boost your midterm score if you do better on the final, so that's really helpful.
Written Exam 2 Grade: 111.5/102The same deal with this one. The final wasn't cumulative, but there are some foundational elements you still need to remember. On all the exams, he offers extra credit questions. For this one, 13 extra credit points could be earned. These questions really help boost your grade, as you can see.
Practical Exam 1 Grade: 110.425/115For this session, we had 33 stations in lab. Each station had a specimen/model/printout and a set of 3-4 questions about them. Usually there's a pin/sticker on it that requires you to identify structures and then other questions about function, etc. You write down your answers on the blanks on a sheet of paper on a clipboard. You have 3.5 minutes at each station before you have to rotate. You can't go back to a station, so if you're stuck, write down some details so you can mull it over later. You either can answer all the questions really quickly and are bored waiting for time to be up or you get stuck and don't have enough time. There were 3 rest stations thrown in there so you can go over your answers. You have to be as specific as possible when giving your answers, as they'll mark you down for incompleteness. For this practical, really study the origins and insertions of the muscles! There are a lot of questions on those, and I didn't study them enough and got a lot wrong. My initial grade was a 107/115, but I was boosted by my final practical score. There are some extra credit questions here too, and they can relate to stuff learned in lecture. But focus mainly on lab material and really utilize open labs to review the models/specimens. I didn't go to office hours, but those are also a good opportunity to go over models and ask questions.
Practical Exam 2 Grade: 99/100This practical was the same format. This is also not cumulative. It was significantly easier than the musculoskeletal system, as this practical goes over the systems - cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, urogenital. Overall, the second half of the course had easier material.
Final Grade: A+I really enjoyed taking this class. Not only was the material really interesting and relevant to what career I want to pursue, but Dr. Friscia was a really great professor with a fair grading scheme. Highly recommend taking this course over the summer if you need to take it for grad school."
Anthony R Friscia,Physci 13,Introduction to Human Anatomy,Winter 2017,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted May 11, 2017",A+,"This was probably my favorite class at UCLA. Professor Friscia explained and presented the topics SUPER clearly. And despite how long the lectures were, they passed by surprisingly fast because the lectures were so engaging (or there was just so much information that I was super focused lol). Out of all of the professors I've had at UCLA, he presented the material the most clearly. The class is A LOT of memorization, but it's not that bad if you give yourself ~2-3 good days to memorize and review the stuff. 
The exams were fair and honestly pretty easy lol. There were no trick questions and as long as you memorized everything, you were fine. There was plenty of extra credit on the midterm and final, so getting 100%+ on the written portions were definitely manageable.
I also want to mention that he presents some of the clinical applications of some of the anatomy you memorize, which makes the experience much more memorable and valuable. The structure and nature of this class made it the best ever. I don't have any other anatomy classes to compare the experience to, but I really do think the quality of this class with Friscia was definitely one of the best."

She was so confusing, hard to understand, not helpful, and just made the class as painful as possible. I took it during C sesh, so maybe it was due to crammed time, but the class was easily the worst I have taken at UCLA. The coding and exams are such a pain. If you are naturally good at statistics or already have basic knowledge, maybe this class will be fine. If not, I would HIGHLY recommend avoiding her."

Worst class I've taken. I had to use the slides from Christou because she was just awful. She has no idea how to give lectures and is extremely rude to students. Office hours are horrible and she is very condescending. During lecture she can also be very rude. She is all over the place when she lectures and she doesn't explain why equations work. The class itself isn't too difficult but she makes it unbearable, and the amount of homework she gives is unreasonable, this class was a lot of busy work."
Juana Sanchez,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Summer 2016,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Aug. 30, 2016",N/A,"If you're like me, you read the (overwhelmingly) negative reviews for Professor Sanchez and thought ""I'll be all right. I'm good at stats, I'm a solid student, it won't be a problem."" In hindsight, I now realize that was the stupidest possible thing I could think. Sanchez is truly a horrible professor. I guarantee you will regret taking her for any and every stats class she teaches. DO NOT TAKE SANCHEZ. Even if that means you have to delay your plans by a quarter, do it. It's worth it.
Technically, this review is not for Stat 10, it's for Stat 20, but her teaching ability is equally bad across all classes (I have friends who have taken her for upper divs and for Stat 10 and wholeheartedly agree with me). To add some background about me, I took the equivalent of Stat 10 at a community college my senior year (got a 97%). I also got all As and Bs my first year at UCLA. I took Sanchez during the summer for 20, and oh. my. god. Sanchez is horrendous. She takes points off for absolutely no reason (trust me, read the other reviews). Her tests are confusing and unnecessarily difficult. Her notes are full of errors and her lectures are impossible to follow. I ended up dropping the class as I was struggling to even reach for a C-. It's not the material, it's 100% her."
Juana Sanchez,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,Summer 2016,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Aug. 29, 2016",N/A,"Look, I realize taking a class in the summer is already going to cause it to be a lot more difficult. With that being said, the fact of the matter here is that whether or not Juana Sanchez is a brilliant researcher and wonderful head of the Statistics department, she is by far one of the most outrageous professors I have dealt with in more than 4 years at this university. This needs to be addressed.
To start she is so impossibly difficult to understand during her lectures that it has sparked more than one heated discussion among ALL of the students in the class about the difficulty of figuring out what she wants. An example: after the first lab was assigned, when we went to turn it in everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, had completed the lab in a completely different way because of the way she attempted to explain the directions. And not just because she has a thick accent and poor English, but she sidetracks herself during the lectures by ranting about her bad Bruinwalk reviews and berating students who are less than 5 minutes late, thereby completely forgetting her own lecture and backtracking on her own ideas. 
 She then assigns such a ludicrous amount of lab work that even our TA has blatantly complained to the students about the amount of work she inundates the class with, but even with his suggestion she refuses to change the workload. If all that isn't bad enough, she also took away a girls water during an exam simply because, and I quote:
""You have to suffer along with everybody else."" I mean really? Sanchez isn't a bad professor, she is a completely unacceptable one."

I would wait another quarter if you need to take a stats class, or take 100A with Jaffe, then take this class. Both herself and the TAs are UNCLEAR and act like you are stupid when you don't understand a concept. Jaffe literally explained her entire class in a matter of 3 weeks and I understood everything. Avoid this class at all costs."
Juana Sanchez,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 9, 2015",N/A,"Very unclear. Her powerpoints and the textbook helped me self-study but there was no real teaching from her whatsoever. Spending 50 minutes in the classroom listening to her talk is a waste of your time. 
There is an attendance sheet and she doesn't give enough time for exams because she talks about random distracting shit for the first 15 minutes. 
There were midterm practice tests but she didn't provide a final practice test. Wanna know why? If 90% (I think it was 90%... it was something absurd) of the students didn't fill an evaluation for the course, she said she wouldn't make a practice test for the final. We didn't reach the number of evaluations she wanted so we didn't get one.
If you took stats in high school you'll be fine. If you've never touched stats, this won't be fun."
Juana Sanchez,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 24, 2015",N/A,"This is the first C that I have ever received at UCLA. Honestly, I couldn't understand anything that she or the TAs were trying to teach us due to their heavy accents. As far as her tests go, for our second midterm, 60% of the class received Ds or lower, and she would not curve. On testing days, she spends the first ten minutes trying to arrange everyone in the right seats, tries to make sure that all students have different test colors, and does not let us start the exam until all of the late students are sitting in their appropriate seats. Lab discussions/normal discussions are a waste of time because she expects the TAs to cover a lot of information in a short amount of time, and its impossible. The TAs just end up writing a bunch of answers/codes on the board and expect you to get it (aka this class is all about teaching yourself)."
Juana Sanchez,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 17, 2015",N/A,"Lectures are pointless, she gets off topic and speeds through the slides before you have a chance to write anything down. She takes attendance so you kind of have to go through, but you can sign in and then leave and watch it on bruin cast if you want. If you can teach yourself, this isn't a bad class. It's pretty doable, everything is multiple choice though and she supplies practice exams for the midterms and final."
Juana Sanchez,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 3, 2015",N/A,"My honest unbiased feedback. I will try to refrain from letting emotion dictate my review. 
Professor Sanchez is not precisely fluent in English. This is an issue because she makes typos on exams, homework, slides, and in general will ask a question in a way that is hard for the student to answer because she is really trying to ask something else. I get the feeling she really doesn't care about students grades, and another major gripe is her exams. The class time is only 50minutes, and yet she gives us 20-25 questions, and spends the first 10 or so mins berating the class for not being able to follow her, and Im not being mean here, completely useless instructions. For example, if you are right handed, you cannot sit in a left handed desk. Combined with the fact that she spaces rows and students, you really only have 40mins for 20-25 questions (2mins/question) after students find their seats. She doesn't curve, there is a ton of HW and busy work, and she does treat it like a high school class. Like other reviewers, I recommend a different professor because UCLA does have some great ones, and they won't bombard you with hw or can teach you better. She does say funny stuff though."
Juana Sanchez,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 11, 2012",N/A,"Everything people said is true. My only beef with Sanchez is her ridiculous attendance and participation policy. But that may also be because I must have been the only person in the history of her class to have been called on 3 times from her random class selection program. Seriously, 200+ students and I got chosen 3 times."
Juana Sanchez,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 27, 2012",N/A,"She's not wonderful, she's not terrible. Anybody who says otherwise is either completely blind and deaf or just a complainer.
I went into her class, having read through all of these Bruinwalk evaluations, and found her more pleasant than expected. If you take the class with a sense of humor, she's really amusing. Sure, she makes mistakes on her powerpoints and her attendance rules are so high school, but it's not a deal-breaker. She has her own sense of humor, and because I don't go in there to pay attention, I find her jokes really amusing to pass the time.
The class isn't difficult. I ended up with an A-. I got a B on my first midterm, an A on my second midterm, and a C on my final. She doesn't make the class hard. Our second midterm and our final were both online. We have quizzes and homework that end up being a lot of busywork, but if you actually do them, it will really help keep your grade high. There's a project that takes about 1-2 hours to complete, and I easily got full marks on that.
Her lectures are pretty useless. You go for participation grades though. So I ended up doing most of my Italian homework during Stats lectures. And discussion sections start with a quiz, so after that, feel free to get up and leave. The weekly labs can be almost fully completed during lab section (if you don't waste time listening to the TA), or you can leave after the sign-in sheet is passed around. It's a really easy class to bullshit your way through if you know basic statistics - which surprisingly enough, most people actually didn't, so they had to pay attention during lectures, ask TA questions, and help their own learning out a little. The good thing about having like, 50 questions a week to do on Pearson for homework, is that that is literally how I learned everything. That and the textbook. 
I would take this professor again. She won't leave you with a lasting impression, so don't expect to be inspired. Anticipate her style of teaching, tell yourself to ctfo, learn everything from Pearson practice homework problems (my TA Xian was utter crap), and you'll do fine."
Juana Sanchez,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted June 20, 2012",N/A,"This class started out being very simple, and it remained so until at least the first midterm. This was mainly because you didn't need the professor to understand the material. However, around the middle of the course, the material does get quite difficult. I was saved by my TA from doing poorly-his labs and his grading on my final project (despite the fact that I half-assed it) saved my grade. Doing all of the homework also raised my grade, along with doing well on the quizzes (which are easy if you had do the homework). The good thing about this class is that you can rack up a lot of points in the beginning and that will really help carry you if all you care about is a grade. The professor will not help you at all however, you must rely on the website (MyPearson got me an A- no joke) and your TA. I ended up getting a D on the final but still got an A- in the class.

It's completely pointless and wastes everyone's time because most of the time, people aren't in class or get the answer wrong. Luckily for me, I already knew the material and most of the class was review. If I didn't have this knowledge, I would have struggled because her lectures are not informative in any way. The tests and homeworks are pretty easy, but the final was relatively difficult and everyone that I knew did poorly on it. I got an A-, but I would highly recommend avoiding this class at all costs."

The only redeeming feature were her TAs-- Miles Chen is amazing, and he is the only reason why I stayed as long as I did.

Lectures were mediocre; the prof talks really fast and scribbles everywhere on the board. I think the biggest problem I have with this class is how it was structured: two lectures (mon+fri), 1 lab, 1 discussion, homework, and quizzes all in one week. It's a lot to cram within one week and I felt that lab and the discussions were useless -- we could've been better off having lectures instead. Even so, lectures provided little help because the homework problems, etc were far more complicated than what we covered in lectures. My TA was terribly inefficient in helping us learn the material. She never explained anything well and confused us even more. Beware if you take this class, I taught myself everything by reading the book."

Juana Sanchez,Stats 10,Introduction to Statistical Reasoning,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted March 15, 2006",N/A,"Caveat: I am writing this review before I receive my class final grade. This is not a good class or a good prof. I took AP stats and got a 5 on the AP exam which is the only reason I do well in the class. The lectures are very slow and Prof is hard to understand, oftentimes confused, and also spends a lot of time off-topic. Because all the material is review, I can usually figure out what she is trying to explain; however, for first-time stats students this must be extremely frustrating. This is not to say the material is difficult to understand, rather that her lectures don't really do anything to make it accessible to the statistics-uninclined. I aced the midterm and receive relatively high grades on everything else. But whoever grades the homework is an absolute killer. I am anal retentive about how I do my homework, but I still get slammed 0.3 points on every third problem for no reason I can figure out. On many problems I show work and get the right answer but still lose half the points. And as far as I can tell I don't see the worst of it. Hopefully my test scores will buoy me to a decent grade (I still don't understand why they no longer let people pass out of this class - the subject material is much easier than what my HS AP stats class covered), but really I just need to pass because the class is a prereq. Whether you know no stats or you are a statistics whiz, do your best to avoid Stats 10 with Sanchez. If you know stats you will probably do okay but develop a strong dislike for the class, if you don't know stats I doubt you will learn much. In addition, no one is really sure how the grades work. If there is no curve and everything is based on the grades we see, this class would qualify as insanely difficult. In any event, college classes should not be this absurd."

The format for the class is also ridiculous...there are two lectures a week, two discussions a week, and TWO (why?) online quizzes a week. I don't know whether this lady thinks this really works or just wants to know that she has our attention for an unneccessarily long period of time. I'm so irritated with this class that I almost don't care what grade I get (so long as it's a passing one), just so I can be done with this.

The book is terrible and difficult to follow, and the reader is disorganized, illegible, and completely useless. Unlike any other class I've taken, the tests are graded only by looking at the final answer, so if you make any small mistakes that throw off your answer, even though you've clearly shown that you KNOW how to do the problem, you get no credit at all.

Would highly recommend to always check out the bruin test bank, because her final and midterms USUALLY have incredibly similar questions, just different numbers. The textbook reading is dense (especially when you hit quantum mechanics), and not really helpful. I'm not really the type of person who goes to a professor's office hours, but I did benefit going to the office hours of some of the TA (if Derrick still TA's I would highly recommend him!). Make sure to attend discussion and write down EVERYTHING from lectures. Someone on bruinwalk already mentioned how it's pretty important to catch the small details she mentions in the passing in lecture, and I can attest to that. She also definitely has an accent, but knows the material well and can teach well enough. That being said, realize you are going to have to put in work to yield good results.

The 2 midterms were on Wednesdays, and I studied for them during the weekend before and scored very high. I probably studied the same amount for the final since it wasn't cumulative and was essentially a 3 hour midterm on the last ⅓ of the course.

I don't think her Russian accent was really that distracting or difficult to understand. For me, I think she was so intelligent that she struggled at times to communicate effectively to her class. Nevertheless, important concepts she reiterates across multiple classes, which makes it easier to understand and office hours help clarify as well. To thrive in this class I recommend reviewing ALL the concepts by studying the notes carefully, reviewing owl problems and using the book as a guide to clarify anything in lecture (no need to understand everything in the book, a lot is just background info). If you put in some time here and there it is completely manageable and you will do well.
The test questions were a little wonky. Her first test was pretty easy, because it resembled her old test and covered fairly simple concepts (the average was mid-high B's). However, she quickly learned that students were studying off of old tests. The second midterm was harder but generally not too bad (average was a low C). I think most people were upset and will claim the class to have gotten ""really hard"" because they expected it to be the same question types as her old 2nd midterm. However, literally everything on all her tests were based off of problems emphasized in lecture. Nothing is unfair about her tests and by reviewing all her lecture notes and owl problems, you should have all the necessary knowledge to succeed. I struggled more with stupid mistakes than knowing how to answer the questions, because little errors can cost you a good amount of points. The class was generally really fair, though, especially compared to other professors who occassionally test on random concepts that weren't covered in lecture.
Overall, I feel like I am prepared to succeed in future chemistry classes even though she didn't emphasize the quantitive aspect of chem. Oh and one last note: she applies a generous curve at the end where the average student (hitting the average grades on all tests) will end up with a B-/B as opposed to a C or C+ in some other classes!

That said, watch out for errors in HER notes. Yep. She makes mistakes, more than handful, but less than a dozen, so that's good i guess. Go to her office hours if you are not sure about something she said. She has a Russian accent. Not too thick, but you should pay attention when she speaks or you will miss what she said. She is a bit quieter than other teachers. In terms of tests, they are fair, mostly based on notes stuff. But beware. Some stuff does come from the book that she may not have talked too much about. Read the book and do practice problems to familiarize yourself with certain thought processes rather than question types. She knows how to make diverse questions.

Bottom line is she is a traditional professor who doesnt rely on technology to teach her material. I cant say she is tough or easy. Thats different from person to person.

He tells you to get it at the begging of the quarter but you never use it and everything you need is on cycle. 2) His problem sets are impossible unless you go to office hours (they are also graded on completion so you dont have to know how to do them when they are due but you MUST KNOW THEM FOR THE EXAMS!!!!!! 3) His office hours are key! they aren't necessarily necessary but he goes over the entire problem set throughout them and clarifies his kind of confusing lectures 4) A good TA is a lifesaver (specifically Jesus the man is a GOD and will pretty much teach you everything you need to know in a quick rundown at the beginning of each discussion and in review) 5) His tests are pretty much copy and pastes of his problem sets and his review so for the love of God know how to do them. 6) Most importantly value this man! he tries so hard to help everyone and is an amazing professor who does get the love and credit he deserves. Coming from a student who almost failed I take 100% responsibility for my grade and it is not at all his fault because he really cares and wants you to succeed. I wish you luck and work harder than I did because it only gets harder from here and you could have ended up in Baugh who is awful! (not a bad person just not a great teacher)

I don't think you're gonna do any better for Chem classes. HW closely resembled exams and the exams were pretty reasonable. Only thing I'll say is the second midterm was way harder than the other tests. Don't underestimate it. If you're confused, go to office hours, it's very helpful."

Beren cares about his students and wants you to do well. Take him!! He's super sweet, is very passionate about what he teaches and I loved having him for 20A and 20B. Do the discussion worksheets and the homeworks and take notes, as long as you stay on track with that plus a littel studying, you will do great in this class. I only took HP Chem in high school and I was able to well and I know I could've done better but I made stupid mistakes on the midterm and final (which were both very fair)."

I may have not done well in this class, but that's my own fault. He does everything he can possibly to do make class easier for his students.

For this class, I highly recommend you stay on top of the work, and make sure you don't fall behind. There are problem sets assigned weekly, and these tend to be pretty hard. My advice is to start these pretty early in the week, when they are first assigned. Then, as you work through these problems, go to his office hours and get help on the ones you don't understand. These problem sets are extremely important, as most of the problems on the midterm are different variations on the problem sets. Also, even though the lectures are bruincasted, and there is no way to track class attendance, I recommend going to each and every lecture. This will ensure you don't fall behind in the class, and will help you understand the material more. Overall, the class is really cool, though it might get tricky at times, especially during the stuff on quantum. However, Beren is a great guy who tries his absolute hardest to help students understand the material. I did not do so hot in this class, but I take sole responsibility for that."

Having very little background in this stuff, I began losing track of the material so early on that I was behind on everything for the whole quarter. It was difficult for me to conceptualize such abstract topics like quantum stuff, I just didn't fully understand anything for the most part. Because of this, I thought midterms were gonna be bad each time I took them, but it turns out that as long as you write stuff down you're bound to get partial credit... I got mid-high 70s for each midterm. I got a C overall, probably because I studied almost nothing for the final (big mistake), luckily a passing grade though. Christian is a great teacher, I'm sure, as the other students seem to love him so much (and he's the only choice other than Baugh), but I just don't understand nor enjoy the subject."

The most frustrating thing I remember was that the problem sets he assigns for homework are nothing like the test. Definitely need to go to office hours if you want to understand what he's going to test you on. He makes the tests much much harder than the homework and the discussion worksheets in order to get a variety of test scores."
Christian Evan Beren,Chem 20A,Chemical Structure,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Feb. 18, 2020",B+,Beren is the best. He's a really good teacher and if you don't get it in lecture go to his office hours which are very helpful. What really stands out is how organized he is. All of his lectures are well structured and thorough and he makes the (also very organized) notes available to you online. The homework is helpful and so are the discussion problems because they reflect the midterms well. I highly recommend taking Beren if you can.

As this was his 1st quarter teaching 20A the homework was sometimes worded poorly and it was a hassle trying to figure out what he meant when he defined a term in class then used a different one for the homework. I felt that the content was pretty easy and he went very slowly, so studying for midterms/final wasn't bad."
Christian Evan Beren,Chem 20A,Chemical Structure,Fall 2019,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Jan. 6, 2020",A,The material is very quantum heavy and can get confusing if you get lost in the math but Beren does a great job of explaining most of the material. Having a good TA (shout out to Jesus) definitely helps out a lot.

To be fair, this was his first time teaching 20A so he was kind of writing the class as he went along which showed in his preparedness with slides and textbook readings. He made the homework really hard so that we would go to office hours, but I think if you know a bit about chemistry and use google, you can do it on your own. I found the discussion sheets the most helpful part of the out of class work because they were a really good way of reviewing the material he gave in lecture. I highly recommend attending his lectures because there is a lot of really good information that is incredibly helpful on the homework. I found the first midterm to be quite easy, but with the second midterm he touched on topics that we barely saw in class so be careful of that. The final exam was also quite difficult but it was doable with a good amount of studying.Overall, I would recommend taking Beren over the other professors after reading the reviews on their pages."

I am not sure if it is because this is his first time teaching 20A, but his lectures and homework did a horrible job of preparing students for the exams.

I personally really enjoyed his class, even with it's rather difficult subject matter, and am pretty positive it has to do with having Beren as a teacher. Because this was his first time teaching the class there were some bumps in the road, but overall I think he did a good job. The first midterm and final were fair with the second midterm being a good amount more difficult. The homework for the most part is way more difficult than the tests so don't stress too much if you can't solve them since they're pretty confusing and are graded based on effort not accuracy. I ended up turning in a couple hws late due to forgetting to give them to my TA and still got full credit. If you ever have any questions, definitely go to his office hours as I ended going around once a week (3 times during finals week) and it was immensely helpful for any confusions I had (although plan on coming with your questions ready). Also definitely go to discussion as you learn a lot of the applicable skills to tests and hws during that time. I was pretty bummed about my grade since I actually really enjoyed the course and its subject. By no means is a B+ a bad grade, but it was a little disappointing after getting a 97% on the first midterm and an ok score on the second one to not get my goal score in the class, but it was my mistake since I personally thought the final was very fair but wound up with a C on it which tanked my grade. Overall would highly recommend taking Beren for Chem 20A."

Emily A Carter,Chem 20A,Chemical Structure,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Jan. 14, 2004",N/A,"Dr. Carter shows an apparent lack of preparation for lectures (especially when compared to Dr. Scerri). Also, she goes very fast, but stops to answer questions during lecture. It still isn't very helpful. My biggest gripe is that you're continuously furiously jotting down notes every lecture, where Scerri's class can passively sit and follow along in their course readers, therefore greatly increasing the amount of material absorbed per lecture.Be prepared to study hard on your own if you get Dr. Carter. On the bright side, she's not that hard, just that her lackluster lecturing makes the course seem hard."
Emily A Carter,Chem 20A,Chemical Structure,N/A,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted Dec. 10, 2003",N/A,"Early in the quarter, My friends and I had already felt the sincere, intense enthusiasm this professor has about chemistry. This woman simply LOOOOOOVVVVE chem and her research. Her endless energy and spunky attitude in class not only won her my respect, they also encouraged me to focus even more on this class.
As a teacher, I would have to say she goes over materials very rapidly. She loses no time in every single lecture. If you don't read the textbook on time, it's very easy to get lost. (In fact, it would be best if you read ahead.) But if you do catch up with the reading, her explanation of chem concepts are very clear and she welcomes all questions if you have any.
The hw she assigns however, is not always relevant to the concepts that she stresses in lectures. There will be hw problems that you do and you never need to know in midterms or final. Doing hw is essential in this class since she writes REALLY, REALLY difficult exams. It IS possible to do well on them, but most of us freshmen just aren't at that level yet. But trust me, there will be people getting above 90% still.
About the exams, like I said, it's doable, but I feel they are a bit too difficult for an intro chem class. However, if you read, do all your hw, and go to office hours when you need to, Prof Carter will already have provide all the help you need to get at least a B. 
Overall, I would recommend this professor to you if you are not a slacker, because slackers die SO FAST in this class, it's not funny. If you don't love chem, don't take her either, because she's a bit much for you if you don't enjoy this subject. So basically, if you enjoy chem, don't mind a bit of extra work, and want a prof that actually cares about her students and the subject, by all means, try Carter.

Dr. Carter goes way too fast, and writes very messily on a board, you can't see unless you're in the front 4 rows. The online quizzes, the homework and the tests do not reflect each other at all. The discussion sections are a joke! You sit in a room for an hour listening to someone who can't speak english, try to teach you stuff that Dr. Carter won't teach you herself. Dr. Carter is also very sketchy on your grades...she said 60 percent was good for a freshman class...how is that supposed to make me feel better??? She has the notion that everyone knows as much as the 4-5 knowitalls who yell out questions that no normal person would ask...since they have no idea what's going on.

She goes through the content in a thorough way and gives lots of examples. The homework is more challenging than her examples but it's a great way to practice for the tests. My only complaint is about the harsh grading on the midterms and final. You will get marked down on the tiniest things. Even if your process was correct and you got the correct answer May will mark you down if you don't include exactly what she wants you to. Only considering the content and workload, this class was easier for me than the other calculus classes in the series. The tests, however, are so hard to get right. Even though May is a great professor I think she needs to adjust her grading to be a bit more open ended. The tests are doable though and honestly much easier than tests in other math classes I have taken. It's just the grading that got me. Overall, an interesting class and professor May is very sweet."

She gives super clear lectures and explains things well. There are two grading schemes: 10% homework, 35% best midterm, 55% final OR 10% homework, 25% each midterm, 40% final. However, she stresses that the midterms and final are going to be more than just the simple, straightforward examples we do in class and in homework. To study for the exams, I would highly recommend reviewing all the worksheets from section because the questions are VERY similar. She also posts practice exams and solutions about a week before the exams. I found the two midterms to be not too difficult and actually easier than the practice tests she posted, but the final was definitely harder than the practice test. The material also definitely gets harder as the quarter goes along. Overall would recommend taking it with her though."

Clover May,Math 32A,Calculus of Several Variables,Fall 2018,Pre COVID-19,"Submitted April 5, 2019",A,"So I must say I am little puzzled by most of the reviews here. I took Dr. May Fall 2018 and thought she was excellent. Her lectures were very clear and she was very good at explaining subtleties which, though generally not necessary to know for the exams, helped me gain greater appreciation for math.
It's a little hard for me to say how difficult she really is. I got a C+ on my first exam, and started worked like crazy (close to 3hrs. a day). I made sure to do most of the challenging problems from every chapter and also worked through problems I found online. I did better on the second midterm (B+) and well enough on the final to get an A in the class. At the time I was taking the class, I considered it to be really tough, but then again, I do not know how much of it was just me getting used to the pace of UCLA classes. Furthermore, although I studied a lot for the class, I am unsure how much all my studying helped. I think I could have studied a lot less and done just as well. Furthermore, the averages on all exams were quite high. I found it pretty difficult to score above the average, though I consistently scored well above the average in 32B, so, again, while I found it hard, I am unsure how this class really matches up to other classes. I will say that based on what I was seeing from other sections of 32A, May's class was the toughest. In any event, she is definitely worth it.
Tips: VISUALIZE EVERYTHING. She loves testing whether or not you can visualize crazy functions in 3D. Really understand the practice midterms. If you understand everything really well on the practice midterms who should be able to get at least a B. She's really not there to trick you. If she stresses something in class, you definitely want to know it. If brushes over a topic, it's probably not going be heavily featured on the exam.
If you're struggling, talk to her. She is very helpful, especially if she sees that you care."

Exams are reasonable and doable based on homework and worksheets, but there are some challenge problems. Overall, though, if you understand the worksheets, homework, and concepts, you'll be fine!Homework is partially based on completion, partially on correctness, so make sure you check your work on that, too, but there's buffer since it's only partially graded on correctness. Worksheets are participation points, and they are often helpful for the exams, so make sure you study them!This class needs a bit of visualization skills, so if you're on a break, try going to geogebra.org/3d (she'll talk about this site!) to play around with equations-- it might help you wrap your brain around these 3D graphs! And it's just plain fun.Professor May also seems to care about our class culture. One day, we spent a bit of time talking about equity and privilege (basically anonymous polls about ""how often do you think about this aspect of your identity?""), and she often encourages centering techniques, like deep breathing and naming 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, etc.Overall, this was a super cool and underrated class.

Because of this, most of her lectures don't manage to go beyond what's written in the textbook (I ended up not going to 1/2 the lectures because I could just study out of the textbook and go to discussions and I still got a 92 on the second midterm).
